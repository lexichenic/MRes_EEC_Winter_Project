The rapid decay and death of long-lived trees can significantly impact forest dynamics, with effects that transmit through ecological networks, becoming more evident in organisms occupying high trophic levels, such as large and specialized woodpecker species. However, understanding how populations of high trophic level species respond to climate change is still a challenge. In this study it was analyzed 32-year data of social groups of the Magellanic Woodpecker (Campephilus magellanicus) in North Patagonia, a region facing increasingly frequent droughts and increased temperatures. A positive trend in the size of woodpecker social groups as a response to climate-induced tree senescence was tested. A causal structural equation model examining climate- tree senescence- woodpecker relationships was used. Increasing nonlinear trends and positive interannual growth rates (>10%) for tree senescence and group size were found. Lowland forest sites had higher levels of tree senescence and more numerous social groups. The causal model supported the positive effect of mean temperature on tree senescence and the positive association of woodpeckers with tree senescence. These results provide evidence of a climate-induced increase in tree senescence that causes an increase in the size of woodpecker social groups. It is suggested that accelerated decay and mortality of trees in the northern Patagonian forests will decrease the stocks of deadwood in the long term, threatening the persistence of this large woodpecker species. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116033816

Yet, to date, biotic factors have seldom been tested as sources of transgenerational effects in plants. In a greenhouse experiment with the generalist annual Polygonum persicaria, we tested for effects of parental competition on offspring by growing isogenic parent plants either individually or in competitive arrays and comparing their seedling progeny in contrasting growth environments. Offspring of competing vs. non-competing parents showed significantly altered development, resulting in greater biomass and total leaf area, but only when growing in neighbor or simulated canopy shade, rather than sunny dry conditions. A follow-up experiment in which parent plants instead competed in dry soil found that offspring in dry soil had slightly reduced growth, both with and without competitors. In neither experiment were effects of parental competition explained by changes in seed provisioning, suggesting a more complex mode of regulatory inheritance. We hypothesize that parental competition in moist soil (i.e., primarily for light) confers specific developmental effects that are beneficial for light-limited offspring, while parental competition in dry soil (i.e., primarily for belowground resources) produces offspring of slightly lower overall quality. Together, these results indicate that competitive conditions during the parental generation can contribute significantly to offspring variation, but these transgenerational effects will depend on the abiotic resources available to both parents and progeny. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116460574

We show that mean adult M can be approximated from the general law of decay if the average maximum age reached by individuals in a cohort is known. This is possible because the proportion P of individuals surviving to the average maximum age in a cohort is surprisingly similar across a wide range of examined species at 1.5%. The likely reason for the narrow range of P is a universal increase in the rate of mortality near the end of life, providing strong evidence that the evolutionary theories of ageing are the norm in natural populations. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107388598

Maximisation of fragrance coincides with floral maturation in many angiosperms, which enhances pollination efficiency, reduces floral predation, and improves plant fitness. We hypothesized that petal monoterpenes serve additional lifelong functions such as limiting metabolic damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altering isoprenoid hormonal abundance to increase floral lifespan. Petal monoterpenes were quantified at three floral life-stages (unopened bud, open mature, and senescent) in 57 rose species and 16 subspecies originating from Asia, America, and Europe, and relationships among monoterpene richness, petal colour, ROS, hormones, and floral lifespan were analysed within a phylogenetic context. Three distinct types of petal monoterpene profiles, revealing significant developmental and functional differences, were identified: Type A, species where monoterpene abundance peaked in open mature flowers depleting thereafter; Type B, where monoterpenes peaked in senescing flowers increasing from bud stage, and a rare Type C (8 species) where monoterpenes depleted from bud stage to senescence. Cyclic monoterpenes peaked during early floral development, whereas acyclic monoterpenes (dominated by geraniol and its derivatives, often 100-fold more abundant than other monoterpenes) peaked during floral maturation in Type A and B roses. Early-diverging roses were geraniol-poor (often Type C) and white-petalled. Lifetime changes in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) revealed a significant negative regression with the levels of petal geraniol at all floral life-stages. Geraniol-poor Type C roses also showed higher cytokinins (in buds) and abscisic acid (in mature petals), and significantly shorter floral lifespan compared with geraniol-rich Type A and B roses. We conclude that geraniol enrichment, intensification of petal colour, and lower potential for H2O2-related oxidative damage characterise and likely contribute to longer floral lifespan in monoterpene-rich wild roses. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088627331

Cross-generational effects of parental age on offspring TL are thought to be a key source of variation, but the rarity of longitudinal studies that examine the telomeres of successive offspring born throughout the lives of parents leaves such effects poorly understood. Here, we exploit TL measures of successive offspring produced throughout the long breeding tenures of parents in wild white-browed sparrow weaver (Plocepasser mahali) societies, to isolate the effects of within-parent changes in age on offspring TLs. Our analyses reveal the first evidence to date of a positive within-parent effect of advancing age on offspring TL: as individual parents age, they produce offspring with longer telomeres (a modest effect that persists into offspring adulthood). We consider the potential for pre- and post-natal mechanisms to explain our findings. As telomere attrition predicts offspring survival to adulthood in this species, this positive parental age effect could impact parent and offspring fitness if it arose via differential telomere attrition during offspring development. Our findings support the view that cross-generational effects of parental age can be a source of inter-individual variation in TL. © 2021 The Author(s).",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119389947

However, its relation to long term health parameters in pre-school children remains unknown, even though pre-school age is crucial for the determining healthy lifelong habits. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the differences in physical fitness level and basic eating habits between normal-weight obese, normal-weight non-obese, and overweight and obese preschoolers. The research sample consisted of 188 preschoolers aged 4.0–6.9 years (Mage = 5.52 ± 0.8 year), normalweight obese = 25; normal-weight non-obese = 143, overweight and obese = 20. Body composition was measured using bio-impedance InBody230. Six tests assessed the physical fitness level: Situps; standing long jump; shuttle running 4 ₓ 5 meters; throwing with a tennis ball; multistage fitness tests; sit and reach. A four-item eating habits questionnaire for parents focusing on breakfast regularity, consumption of sweet foods and drinks, selection of food and attitude towards eating was used. A non-parametric analysis of variance and Fisher’s exact test along with suitable effect sizes were used for data processing of physical fitness tests and the basic eating habits questionnaire, respectively. Normal-weight obese children performed significantly worse (from p = 0.03 to p < 0.001, ES !2-G = low to medium) in muscular fitness, cardiorespiratory fitness and running agility compared to normal-weight non-obese counterparts and did not significantly differ in themajority of physical fitness performance tests from overweight and obese peers. In basic eating habits, normal-weight obese boys preferred significantly more sweet foods and drinks (p = 0.003 ES = 0.35, large), while normal-weight obese girls had significantly more negative attitude towards eating (p = 0.002 ES = 0.33, large) in comparison to their normal-weight non-obese peers. Normal-weight obesity seems to develop from early childhood and is associated with low physical fitness and deficits in eating habits which might inhibit the natural necessity for physically active life from pre-school age or sooner. © 2021 by the authors.

We used colour ringing with a capture–mark–recapture approach to estimate the age distribution, survival and dispersal in a recently recovered Baltic Osprey Pandion haliaetus population. The mean age of breeding Ospreys was 5.5 years (5.5 years in males and 5.4 years in females). The mean age of floaters was 3.1 years (3.3 years in males and 2.9 years in females). The re-sighting probability was best modelled as a time-independent function of five age classes separately for both sexes, and it increased with age. In females, the re-sighting probability increased from 0.03 in 1-year-old birds to 0.77 at 5 years and older; in males, it increased from 0.01 to 0.54. The best models for apparent survival included two age classes. Survival was lower for 1-year-old females (0.14) than males (0.27); the survival difference was retained at > 1 year of age (females 0.64 and males 0.74). Apparent survival (0.72) was similar for satellite-tracked adult Ospreys. Floaters were rare; however, their survival (0.70) was similar to that of breeders. Mean natal dispersal distances were significantly longer for females (164 km) than for males (47 km). Breeding dispersal was recorded in 5% of breeders (mean distance, 11.1 km). The relatively high (apparent) mortality in the Baltic population may be partly explained by competition in breeding grounds and threats during migration and wintering.

Tree mortality assess-ments have mainly been based on forest inventories and are mostly limited to planted forests; few studies have conducted age‐based survival analyses in natural forests. We performed survival analyses of individual tree populations in natural forest stands to evaluate differences in the survival of two coniferous species (Abies sachalinensis (F. Schmidt) Mast. and Picea jezoensis var. microsperma) and all broad‐leaved species. We used tree rings and census data from four preserved permanent plots in pan‐mixed and sub‐boreal natural forests obtained over 30 years (1989–2019). All living trees (diameter at breast height ≥ 5 cm in 1989) were targeted to identify tree ages using a Resisto-graph. Periodical tree age data, for a 10‐year age class, were obtained during three consecutive ob-servation periods. Mortality and recruitment changes were recorded to analyze multi‐temporal age distributions and mean lifetimes. Non‐parametric survival analyses revealed a multi‐modal age distribution and exponential shapes. There were no significant differences among survival probabilities of species in different periods, except for broad‐leaved species, which had longer mean lifetimes in each period than coniferous species. The estimated practical mean lifetime and diameter at breast height values of each coniferous and broad‐leaved tree can be applied as an early identification system for trees likely to die to facilitate the Stand‐based Silvicultural Management System of the University of Tokyo Hokkaido Forest. However, the survival probabilities estimated in this study should be used carefully in long‐term forest dynamic predictions because the analysis did not in-clude the effects of catastrophic disturbances, which might significantly influence forests. The mortality patterns and survival probabilities reported in this study are valuable for understanding the stand dynamics of natural forests associated with the mortality of individual tree populations. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to reduce the adverse effects of increased variability, life-history theory predicts that demographic rates that contribute disproportionately to population growth should be buffered against environmental variation. To date, evidence of demographic buffering is still equivocal and limited to analyses on a reduced number of age classes (e.g. juveniles and adults), and on single sex models. Here we used Bayesian inference models for age-specific survival and fecundity on a long-term dataset of wild mountain gorillas. We used these estimates to parameterize two-sex, age-specific stochastic population projection models that accounted for the yearly covariation between demographic rates. We estimated the sensitivity of the long-run stochastic population growth rate to reductions in survival and fecundity on ages belonging to nine sex-age classes for survival and three age classes for female fecundity. We found a statistically significant negative linear relationship between the sensitivities and variances of demographic rates, with strong demographic buffering on young adult female survival and low buffering on older female and silverback survival and female fecundity. We found moderate buffering on all immature stages and on prime-age females. Previous research on long-lived slow species has found high buffering of prime-age female survival and low buffering on immature survival and fecundity. Our results suggest that the moderate buffering of the immature stages can be partially due to the mountain gorilla social system and the relative stability of their environment. Our results provide clear support for the demographic buffering hypothesis and its predicted effects on species at the slow end of the slow–fast life-history continuum, but with the surprising outcome of moderate social buffering on the survival of immature stages. We also demonstrate how increasing the number of sex-age classes can greatly improve the detection of demographic buffering in wild populations. © 2021 British Ecological Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104510130

We estimate survival probabilities for Peregrines in Britain in the period 1975–2018 from reports of ringed birds found dead, using a non-parametric smoothing spline to account for non-linear temporal variation in recovery probabilities. During this time the population increased from around 350 pairs to 1628 pairs. There was little evidence of a temporal trend in the survival probabilities of adult birds since the mid-1970s, but survival of first-year birds appears to have decreased. Our estimates suggest that increases in the breeding population are further limited by unreported sources of mortality or by density-dependent processes, highlighting the need for better data on immature survival and recruitment.

However, being metabolically active, the germ line accumulates damage and other changes over time, i.e., it ages. For new life to begin in the same young state, the germ line must be rejuvenated in the offspring. Here, we developed a multi-Tissue epigenetic clock and applied it, together with other aging clocks, to track changes in biological age during mouse and human prenatal development. This analysis revealed a significant decrease in biological age, i.e., rejuvenation, during early stages of embryogenesis, followed by an increase in later stages. We further found that pluripotent stem cells do not age even after extensive passaging and that the examined epigenetic age dynamics is conserved across species.

We evaluated the female offspring of these dams (at 2 and 18 months old). The aged offspring fed with FA-deficient diet presented habituation, spatial and aversive memory impairment and the FA maternal supplementation prevented this. The natural aging caused an increase in the TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the hippocampus from 18-month-old offspring. FA maternal supplementation was able to prevent the increase of these cytokines. IL-4 levels decreased in the prefrontal cortex from aged control rats and FA prevented it. FA deficiency decreased the levels of IL-4 in the hippocampus of the young offspring.

Here we examine wild chimpanzee feeding development in the context of two hypotheses regarding prolonged development in primates: the needing-to-learn hypothesis and the expensive brain hypothesis. Material and Methods: We studied wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) offspring at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We analyzed 41 years of observational behavioral data collected between 1975 and 2016 from 81 offspring. We characterized feeding development in the first 10 years of life via four different measures: (1) proportion of observation time spent feeding; (2) diet composition; (3) diet breadth; and (4) diet maturity as measured by similarity to maternal diet. We used mixed effects models to examine changes with age and by sex, while controlling for season. Results: Feeding time, diet breadth, and diet maturity exhibited the most substantial increases with age in the first 6 years, with no significant change thereafter. Males and females showed different patterns of change in diet breadth by age, but did not differ by age 10. Diet composition did not change significantly with age and did not differ by sex. Discussion: We found that chimpanzee offspring attained adult-like feeding behaviors between 4 and 6 years of age, concomitant with the completion of weaning. Thus, our data do not support the needing-to-learn feeding skills hypothesis of a prolonged juvenile period, but additional data are needed to evaluate how and when adolescent chimpanzees are able to make foraging decisions independent of their mothers. Existing data on growth provides support for the expensive brain hypothesis, however, these hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive. As more studies across taxa accumulate sufficient datasets on a range of developmental metrics, we will be able to achieve a more robust understanding of prolonged development in primates. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102466655

The size of the L. tsanensis and L. platydorsus individuals collected was in the range 123-363- and 115-630-mm fork length respectively. For both species, 4- and 5-year-old individuals were dominant, whereas specimens older than 6 years were rarely recorded. The maximum ages recorded for L. tsanensis and L. platydorsus were 11 and 17 years respectively. Of the different growth models evaluated, the logistic growth model yielded the best fit to age-at-length data. For both species, growth parameters differed significantly between males and females, and sexual maturation proceeded faster in males than in females. Natural mortality estimates based on longevity were higher than the estimates based on growth parameters. For both species, females were predominant over males and the length-weight relationships were curvilinear. The estimated life history traits are important input parameters in further stock assessment evaluation of the species and should allow fisheries managers to optimise future conservation strategies. © 2021 CSIRO.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098187715

Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment for Schistosoma japonicum infection in pregnant women has been demonstrated to be safe and effective. Our objectives were to evaluate whether maternal PZQ treatment modifies the process of in utero sensitization to schistosome antigens potentially impacting later risk of infection, as well as immune response to S. japonicum. We enrolled 295 children at age six, born to mothers with S. japonicum infection who participated in a randomized control trial of PZQ versus placebo given at 12–16 weeks gestation in Leyte, The Philippines. At enrollment, we assessed and treated current S. japonicum infection and measured serum cytokines. During a follow-up visit four weeks later, we assessed peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytokine production in response to soluble worm antigen preparation (SWAP) or soluble egg antigen (SEA). Associations between maternal treatment group and the child’s S. japonicum infection status and immunologic responses were determined using multivariate linear regression analysis. PZQ treatment during pregnancy did not impact the prevalence (P = 0.12) or intensity (P = 0.59) of natural S. japonicum infection among children at age six. Among children with infection at enrollment (12.5%) there were no significant serum cytokine concentration differences between maternal treatment groups. Among children with infection at enrollment, IL-1 production by PBMCs stimulated with SEA was higher (P = 0.03) in the maternal PZQ group compared to placebo. Among children without infection, PBMCs stimulated with SEA produced greater IL-12 (P = 0.03) and with SWAP produced less IL-4 (P = 0.01) in the maternal PZQ group compared to placebo. Several cytokines produced by PBMCs in response to SWAP and SEA were significantly higher in children with S. japonicum infection irrespective of maternal treatment: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13. We report that maternal PZQ treatment for S. japonicum shifted the PBMC immune response to a more inflammatory signature but had no impact on their offspring’s likelihood of infection or serum cytokines at age six, further supporting the safe use of PZQ in pregnant women.

Astragaloside possesses a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, including antibacterial, anti-fibrosis, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. However, the role of AS-IV in antiaging remains unclear. In this article, we studied the function of AS-IV in antiaging by using the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model. We showed that AS-IV can prolong the lifespan of C. elegans in a natural aging model, a paraquat injury model, and a heat stress model and improve the movement capacity of nematodes. 1H-NMR data indicate an improvement of glutamate content and a decrease in glucose in the AS-IV treatment group compared with the control. Further investigation revealed that AS-IV can induce the mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) genes and increase the activities of SOD and CAT in the nematode. Interestingly, AS-IV could not extend the lifespan of sod-1, sod-2, sod-3, sod-4, sod-5, ctl-1, ctl-2, ctl-3, and daf-16 mutants. These data indicate that AS-IV prevents aging via mainly improving age-related functional declines, the antioxidant capacity of nematodes and partially modulating the insulin/insulin growth factor 1 signaling pathway activity. Our results provide new insights into how AS-IV prevents and treats aging. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104516803

We aimed to investigate a range of epigenetic ageing biomarkers in a substudy of the NEAT001/ANRS143 clinical trial, which compared ritonavir-boosted darunavir with either raltegravir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive adults. Methods: We analysed frozen whole blood samples from 168 ART-naive participants with HIV from the NEAT001/ANRS143 trial, before ART initiation and after 2 years of ART (84 participants on ritonavir-boosted darunavir with raltegravir and 84 participants on ritonavir-boosted darunavir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine). We also included 44 participants without HIV with a similar age and sex distribution. We analysed DNA methylation. Epigenetic age estimators (Horvath's clock, Hannum's clock, GrimAge, and PhenoAge) and estimated leucocyte compositions were generated using Horvath's New Online Methylation Age Calculator and Houseman's method. We calculated epigenetic age acceleration measures for each estimator of epigenetic age. The NEAT001/ANRS143 trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01066962. Findings: Compared with the HIV-uninfected group, ART-naive participants with HIV showed higher epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) according to all EAA estimators (mean 2·5 years, 95% CI 1·89–3·22 for Horvath-EAA; 1·4 years, 0·74–1·99 for Hannum-EAA; 2·8 years, 1·97–3·68 for GrimAge-EAA; and 7·3 years, 6·40–8·13 for PhenoAge-EAA), with all differences being statistically significant except for Hannum-EAA (Horvath-EAA p=0·0008; Hannum-EAA p=0·059; GrimAge-EAA p=0·0021; and PhenoAge-EAA p<0·0001). Epigenetic ageing was more pronounced in participants who had CD4 counts less than 200 cells per μL (significant for PhenoAge and Hannum's clock, p=0·0015 and p=0·034, respectively) or viral loads over 100 000 copies per mL at baseline (significant for PhenoAge, p=0·017). After 2 years of ART, epigenetic age acceleration was reduced, although PhenoAge and GrimAge remained significantly higher in participants with HIV compared with participants without HIV (mean difference 3·69 years, 95% CI 1·77–5·61; p=0·0002 and 2·2 years, 0·47–3·99; p=0·013, respectively). There were no significant differences in the ART effect on epigenetic ageing between treatment regimens. At baseline, participants with HIV showed dysregulation of DNA methylation-based estimated leucocyte subsets towards more differentiated T-cell phenotypes and proinflammatory leucocytes, which was also partly restored with ART. Interpretation: ART initiation partly reversed epigenetic ageing associated with untreated HIV infection. Further studies are needed to understand the long-term dynamics and clinical relevance of epigenetic ageing biomarkers in people with HIV.

Many studies of birds have indicated that offspring sex ratios can vary with environmental and parental traits. On the basis of long-term research, we first evaluated the possible influence of parental age difference and brood characteristics on offspring sex and fitness in multi-brooded Blackbirds Turdus merula. Methodology. The study was conducted in the city-centre Stefan Żeromski Park in Szczecin, NW Poland, where the local population of Blackbirds has been studied since 1996. Data on the offspring sex and fitness were collected in five years, 2005–2007 and 2016–2017. During the breeding season we inspected the study area to locate the pairs’ territories and to track their nests and clutches. Results. We found that the overall sex ratio did not differ statistically from 50:50, but that younger females bonded with older mates did tend to produce more sons, probably because of the greater fitness of male descendants. Accordingly, the sons’ breeding success increased with the father’s age, but this relationship was close to nonlinear, which may indicate that the transgenerational effect of paternal senescence could negatively affect progeny fitness despite the high-quality of older fathers. Older females mated with younger males produced more daughters, which could have been due to the lesser attractiveness of the males and the mothers’ poorer condition caused by accelerated senescence. We found that neither offspring hatching sequence nor hatching date or clutch sequence were significant for sex determination. Conclusions. We consider that in our Blackbird population, parental age could make a more significant contribution to shaping offspring sex and reproductive success.

In this study, we used mark-recapture data collected during 2014-2018 to assess return rates and apparent survival in relation to age, sex and winter severity in two Common Kingfisher Alcedo atthis populations from Slovakia and the Czech Republic. During five seasons, we ringed a total of 2261 Kingfishers, 353 adults and 1908 nestlings, which yielded 85 recaptures. In total, we recaptured 13.0% of birds ringed as adults (17.5% males, 8.2% females) and 0.8% of those ringed as nestlings (0.7% males, 0.1% females). Surviving adults returned to the previously used nesting hole in 87.0% of cases. Young birds never returned to the hole where they hatched. Breeding dispersal was significantly shorter than natal dispersal. Returned birds started to breed significantly earlier in the year of their return than in the previous year, but breeding success did not vary between these years. Estimated values of apparent survival were quite low, varied annually, and were negatively affected by winter severity. Males did not differ in apparent survival from females, but adults survived better than juveniles. We discuss the difference in apparent survival between the age categories by varying degrees of site fidelity/philopatry and different mortality rates. © 2021 Nederlandse Ornithologische Unie.

However, associations between DNAm age and molecular features of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and its prognosis have not been systematically studied. Method: We calculated the DNAm age of 591 STAD samples and 115 normal stomach samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and gene expression omnibus (GEO) database using the Horvath’s clock model. Meanwhile, we utilized survival analysis to evaluate the prognostic value of DNAm age and epigenetic age acceleration shift. In addition, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify DNAm age-associated gene modules and pathways. Finally, the association between DNAm age and molecular features was performed by correlation analysis. Results: DNA methylation age was significantly correlated with chronological age in normal gastric tissues (r = 0.85, p < 0.0001), but it was not associated with chronological age in STAD samples (r = 0.060, p = 0.2369). Compared with tumor adjacent normal tissue, the DNAm age of STAD tissues was significantly decreased. Meanwhile, chronological age in STAD samples was higher than its DNAm age. Both DNAm age and epigenetic acceleration shift were associated with the prognosis of STAD patients. By using correlation analysis, we also found that DNAm age was associated with immunoactivation and stemness in STAD samples. Conclusion: In summary, epigenetic age acceleration of STAD was associated with tumor stemness, immunoactivation, and favorable prognosis. © Copyright © 2021 Hong, Yang, Wang, Zhang, Wu, Chen, Zhong, Li, Li, Li, Yu, Chen, Zeng and Zhang.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103492530

However, investigators often do not account for factors that influence brood detection probability nor rarely document how much females and their broods are disturbed (flush rates) during surveys, which could lead to biased survival estimates. We used 45 radio-tagged female Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) with broods to compare detection probabilities and document disturbance among four survey methods to allow future investigators to select the method that best meets their objectives. These methods included daytime flush, daytime visual, nocturnal spotlight, and fecal surveys at nocturnal roost sites, with the latter being a novel method. We used Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) models to compare detection probability and daily survival estimates for visual and fecal surveys of broods 0–47 d post-hatch and a double-survey approach to compare detection probabilities among flush, fecal, and spotlight surveys ~42 d post-hatch when investigators often determine brood fate. From CJS models, detection probability for visual surveys increased with brood age (0.618–0.881), whereas detection probability for fecal surveys did not (0.748). Daily survival probability estimates increased with brood age and differed annually based on fecal surveys (2016: 0.978–1.000 and 2017: 0.839–0.998). We detected age-specific daily survival probability with visual surveys (0.956–0.997), but not annual differences. Based on the double-survey approach, detection probability was high (0.857–1.000) for all methods. We flushed ~310–750% fewer females and broods during fecal and spotlight surveys than during both types of daytime surveys. Our results highlight the need to account for detection probabilities among methods and document disturbance to hens and broods that can help investigators design surveys to minimize impacts to birds. Furthermore, our result suggest that actions to improve brood survival during the first week post-hatch may improve local recruitment. © 2021 Association of Field Ornithologists",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103428199

There was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) in daily weight gain and final total length and weight of fish in different experimental groups, however specific growth rate varied significantly (p &lt; 0.05). At the end, hilsa larvae attained a total length of 43.3 ± 0.074 mm, 41.4 ± 0.04 mm, 39.2 ± 0.051 mm, in 3, 5 and 12 DPH groups, respectively. Percentage survival was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) highest (3.40 ± 0.81%) in 5 DPH treatment. Water and gut plankton analysis showed that hilsa larvae are not a selective feeder, but feeds on available food items in the ecosystem through filtration. Length-weight relationship indicated the negative allometric growth (b &lt; 3) pattern in all three groups. Overall, this experiment suggested that 5 DPH is an ideal age for shifting hilsa larvae from larval rearing tank to nursery pond. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095739816

Life history theory predicts that these species will buffer environmental stochasticity via changes in the reproductive investment, while maintaining high adult survival rates. The spur-thighed tortoise was selected as a case study in order to investigate the relationship between the linked maternal characteristics (size and age) and related traits in their hatchlings. We tracked naturally emerging hatchlings from young and old females under semi-natural conditions to test variations in hatchling numbers, body mass, size and survival over two years. We used linear mixed-effect models to analyze variations in hatchling body mass and size, and a mark–release–recapture framework to model their survival. Our study illustrates that old females of long-lived species have greater offspring numbers, greater survival and smaller size when compared with those of young females. The interannual variability evidenced the reduced offspring number and survival in the lower autumn rainfall and spring mean temperature year.

Telomeres are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that are thought to be a biomarker of senescence as their length predicts mortality risk and reflect the physiological consequences of environmental conditions. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to individual variation in telomere length is, however, unclear, yet important for understanding its evolutionary dynamics. In particular, the evidence for transgenerational effects, in terms of parental age at conception, on telomere length is mixed. Here, we investigate the heritability of telomere length, using the ‘animal model’, and parental age at conception effects on offspring telomere length in a wild population of European badgers (Meles meles). Although we found no heritability of telomere length and low evolvability (<0.001), our power to detect heritability was low and a repeatability of 2% across individual lifetimes provides a low upper limit to ordinary narrow-sense heritability. However, year (32%) and cohort (3%) explained greater proportions of the phenotypic variance in telomere length, excluding qPCR plate and row variances. There was no support for cross-sectional or within-individual parental age at conception effects on offspring telomere length. Our results indicate a lack of transgenerational effects through parental age at conception and a low potential for evolutionary change in telomere length in this population. Instead, we provide evidence that individual variation in telomere length is largely driven by environmental variation in this wild mammal. © 2020 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

This study investigates the effect of parental age for both 1- and 2-year-old fish on the growth and survival rates of their larval to grow-out stages for two wild and domesticated strains of bighead catfish (Clarias macrocephalus). Fish were sampled from the Vietnamese Mekong Delta where wild adult fish were collected from a conservation area in Ca Mau Province and domesticated fish were taken from a hatchery in Can Tho. Four offspring treatments of 1- and 2-year-old broodstock strains were reared for 3 successive periods: 40 days for fingerling rearing in static tanks with water exchange, 60 days for juveniles, and 90 days for grow-out in recirculating systems. The final weight of fish at 190 days varied from 96.7 to 144.7 g. The growth of offspring was not affected by parental age (P > 0.05), over the 3 rearing periods. However, the domesticated fish strain showed significantly better growth rates than the wild fish strain (P < 0.05). Feed conversion ratios were comparable across fish treatments. Survival rates did not differ at the fingerling (21.8%–36.4%) and juvenile (69.0%–73.3%) stages.

In natural populations, it is expected that environmental conditions influence an individual's ageing trajectory. Understanding the role of environmental heterogeneity on ageing variation could provide critical insights into population resilience and species distribution but remains overlooked. Telomeres, the end cap of chromosomes, are a promising integrative physiological marker of an individual's health and a possible proxy to aid the understanding of variation in ageing trajectories. Here, we review the existing information on telomere length and its dynamics in wild populations distributed across spatial scales. Despite a relative scarcity of information, there is evidence for divergence in telomere length between populations facing contrasting environments. Nonetheless, a higher spatial resolution and temporal replication are needed to fully understand the role that environmental conditions play on telomere length variation. Since most of the existing studies are correlational, future field and laboratory experiments are required. For the first time, we demonstrate the use of population telomere data to predict species habitat suitability through species distribution models (SDMs). This represents a promising new research area in the study of ageing pattern variation in wild populations. Furthermore, the inclusion of telomere data in future physiological SDMs may improve our understanding of species distribution and population resilience. However, the use of telomeres within this context could be limited if no previous knowledge on the relevance of telomeres as markers of health and survival at the species level is available. Finally, we suggest some key practical and theoretical considerations that, ideally, future studies combining biogeographic and telomere data should pay attention. © 2021 The Authors.

We used long-term individual based data on yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) to quantify how affiliative social behaviours and different life-history traits vary with age and in the last year of life, and how patterns compare between the two. We found that some social behaviours and all life-history traits varied with age, whereas terminal last year of life effects were only observed in life-history traits.

However, the relative influence of environmental and genetic variation on individual telomere length in wild populations remains poorly understood. Heritability of telomere length has primarily been calculated using parent–offspring regression which can be confounded by shared environments. To control for confounding variables, quantitative genetic “animal models” can be used, but few studies have applied animal models in wild populations. Furthermore, parental age at conception may also influence offspring telomere length, but most studies have been cross-sectional. We investigated within- and between-parental age at conception effects and heritability of telomere length in the Seychelles warbler using measures from birds caught over 20 years and a multigenerational pedigree. We found a weak negative within-paternal age at conception effect (as fathers aged, their offspring had shorter telomeres) and a weak positive between-maternal age at conception effect (females that survived to older ages had offspring with longer telomeres). Animal models provided evidence that heritability and evolvability of telomere length were low in this population, and that variation in telomere length was not driven by early-life effects of hatch period or parental identities. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction plate had a large influence on telomere length variation and not accounting for it in the models would have underestimated heritability. Our study illustrates the need to include and account for technical variation in order to accurately estimate heritability, as well as other environmental effects, on telomere length in natural populations. © 2021 The Authors.

As part of the first One-Year Mission aboard the International Space Station, identical twin astronauts Scott and Mark Kelly were the subjects of this ""out of this world"" research opportunity. Telomeres, the natural ends of chromosomes that shorten with cell division and a host of lifestyle factors and stresses, are key molecular determinants of aging and aging trajectories. METHODS: We proposed that telomere length dynamics (changes over time) represent a particularly relevant and integrative biomarker for astronauts, as they reflect the combined experiences and environmental exposures encountered during spaceflight. Telomere length (quantitative polymerase chain reaction and telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization) and telomerase activity (quantitative polymerase chain reaction -telomere repeat amplification protocol) were longitudinally assessed in the space- and earth-bound twins. Chromosome aberrations (directional genomic hybridization), signatures of radiation exposure, were also evaluated. RESULTS: The twins had relatively similar telomere lengths before spaceflight, and the earth-bound twins' telomeres remained relatively stable over the course of the study. Surprisingly, the space twins' telomeres were longer during spaceflight, and upon return to Earth shortened rapidly, resulting in many more short telomeres after spaceflight than before. Chromosomal signatures of space radiation exposure were also elevated during spaceflight, and increased inversion frequencies persisted after spaceflight, suggestive of ongoing genome instability. CONCLUSION: Although the definitive mechanisms underlying such dramatic spaceflight-associated shifts in telomere length remain unclear, improved maintenance of telomere length has important implications for aging science and improving healthspan for those on Earth, as well.

Markers that reflect physiological state and predict future survival would be of considerable benefit to unraveling such trade-offs and could provide insight into individual variation in senescence. However, currently used markers often yield inconsistent results. One underutilized measure is hematocrit, the proportion of blood comprising erythrocytes, which relates to the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity and viscosity, and to individual endurance. Hematocrit has been shown to decline with age in cross-sectional studies (which may be confounded by selective appearance/disappearance). However, few studies have tested whether hematocrit declines within individuals or whether low hematocrit impacts survival in wild taxa. Using longitudinal data from the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), we demonstrated that hematocrit increases with age in young individuals (<1.5 years) but decreases with age in older individuals (1.5–13 years). In breeders, hematocrit was higher in males than females and varied relative to breeding stage. High hematocrit was associated with lower survival in young individuals, but not older individuals. Thus, while we did not find support for hematocrit as a marker of senescence, high hematocrit is indicative of poor condition in younger individuals. Possible explanations are that these individuals were experiencing dehydration and/or high endurance demands prior to capture, which warrants further investigation. Our study demonstrates that hematocrit can be an informative metric for life-history studies investigating trade-offs between survival, longevity, and reproduction. © 2020 The Authors.

Previous studies have indicated that BDE-209 could induce male reproductive toxicity, whereas those of DBDPE remains relatively rare. In this study, we investigated the effects of both BDE-209 and DBDPE on reproductive system in male SD rats, and explored the potential mechanisms under the reproductive toxicity of BDE-209 and DBDPE. Male rats were orally administered with BDE-209 and DBDPE (0, 5, 50 and 500 mg/kg/day) for a 28-day exposure experiment. The current results showed that BDE-209 and DBDPE led to testicular damage in physiological structure, decreased the sperm number and motility, and increased the sperm malformation rates in rat. Moreover, BDE-209 and DBDPE could damage the telomeric function by shortening telomere length and reducing telomerase activity, which consequently caused cell senescence and apoptosis in testis of rat. This could contribute to the decline of sperm quality and quantity. In conclusion, BDE-209 and DBDPE led to reproductive toxicity by inducing telomere dysfunction and the related cell senescence and apoptosis in testis of SD rat.

The effects of chronic low-dose irradiation for natural populations of organisms and their offspring are unknown. The natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster sampled in 2007 in Chernobyl sites with different levels of radiation contamination were investigated. The offspring of specimens from these populations were studied under laboratory conditions to assess the effects of parental irradiation on the mutation process and survival of the offspring. Transgenerational effects of radioactive contamination were observed at the level of gross chromosomal rearrangements (dominant lethal mutations). The frequency of point/gene mutations (recessive sex-linked lethal mutations) of the offspring of the irradiated parents corresponded to the actual level of spontaneous mutations. The survival rate of offspring decreased over 160 generations and significantly correlated with the dominant lethal mutation levels. Our results provide a compelling evidence that other factors (distance from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, time after the initial exposure, selection site and origin of population) can affect the changes in the levels of the studied parameters along with the parental radiation exposure. They can also make a significant contribution to the health of the offspring of animals exposed to radioactive contamination.

Survival analysis deals with age at death (i.e., time to event) data and allows to estimate survivorship and hazard rates assuming that the cross-sectional sample is representative. Accommodating a bathtub-shaped hazard, as expected in wild populations, was historically difficult and required specific models. We identified a simple linear regression model with individual frailty that can fit a bathtub-shaped hazard, take into account covariates, allow goodness-of-fit assessments and give accurate estimates of survivorship in realistic settings. We first conducted a Monte Carlo study and simulated age at death data to assess the accuracy of estimates with respect to sample size. Secondly, we applied this framework on a handful of case studies from published studies on marine mammals, a group with many threatened and data-deficient species. We found that our framework is flexible and accurate to estimate survivorship with a sample size of 300.

Patient (s): All women of reproductive age (18–40 years) treated in Sweden for stage I BOT with the use of FSS or RS from 2008 to 2015, identified in the Swedish Quality Registry for Gynecologic Cancer (SQRGC). Interventions (s): FSS or RS. Main Outcome Measure (s): Reproductive outcomes: natural conception, use of assisted reproductive technology (ART), live birth and obstetrical outcomes. Safety outcome: overall survival (OS) rates, comparing women undergoing FSS versus RS. The FSS cohort was linked to the Swedish Medical Birth Register to identify all women who had given birth after FSS and to obtain detailed obstetrical data. For information on ART treatment, the National Quality Registry for Assisted Reproduction was consulted. OS rate comparisons were conducted by means of Kaplan-Meier estimates. Result (s): Of the 277 women with BOTs, 213 (77%) underwent FSS, 183 (86%) unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and 30 (14%) cystectomy. Following FSS, 50 women gave birth to 62 healthy children, 8% of which were preterm. Only 20 (9%) of the women underwent ART treatment. OS was similar in women treated with FSS and RS. Conclusion (s): Natural fertility was maintained after FSS; only 9% required ART treatment. FSS was also deemed to be equivalent to RS regarding survival outcome. © 2020 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091532589

Methods: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of the difference in the overall survival (OS) among super-elderly (aged ≥ 85 years) NSCLC patients who had received best supportive care alone (BSC group, n = 36), cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT group, n = 11) or EGFR-TKI therapy (TKI group, n = 22). Results: The median age of the patients was 88 years. Among the 35 super-elderly NSCLC patients with an performance status (PS) score of 0–2, 11of 18 EGFR wild-type patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy and 15 of 17 EGFR-mutant patients received EGFR-TKI therapy with gefitinib (n = 13) or osimertinib (n = 2). The OS tended to be longer in the TKI group than in the CT or BSC group (16.9 months vs. 7.2 months or 9.8 months, p = 0.059). Among the 34 super-elderly NSCLC patients with a PS score of 3–4, 7 with EGFR-mutant received gefitinib therapy and the remaining 27 received BSC alone. The OS tended to be longer in the TKI group than in the BSC group (4.6 months vs. 2.3 months, p = 0.060). Multivariate analysis identified a good PS before the start of first-line therapy and presence of active EGFR mutations reduced a risk of death. Conclusions: Gefitinib appears to be useful as a salvage therapy in super-elderly NSCLC patients with active EGFR mutation, regardless of their PS. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089088536

The enzyme’s activity in vitro matches DGAT’s in a number of plant species, however its main function in plants (especially in vegetative tissue) is debatable. In the presented study, we cultivated PDAT1-overexpressing, pdat1 knockout and wild-type lines of Arabidopsis thaliana through their whole lifecycle. PDAT1 overexpression prolonged Arabidopsis lifespan in comparison to wild-type plants, whereas knocking out pdat1 accelerated the plant’s senescence. After subjecting the 3-week old seedlings of the studied lines (grown in vitro) to 2-h heat stress (40°C) and then growing them for one more week in standard conditions, the difference in weight between wild-type and PDAT1-overexpressing lines increased in comparison to the difference between plants grown only in optimal conditions. In another experiment all lines exposed to 2-week cold stress experienced loss of pigment, except for PDAT1-overexpressing lines, which green rosettes additionally weighed 4 times more than wild-type. Our results indicate that plants depleted of PDAT1 are more susceptible to cold exposure, while PDAT1 overexpression grants plants a certain heat and cold resilience. Since it was shown, that lysophospholipids may be intertwined with stress response, we decided to also conduct in vitro assays of acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) and acylCoA:lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase (LPEAT) activity in microsomal fractions from the PDAT1-overexpressing Arabidopsis lines in standard conditions. The results show significant increase in LPEAT and LPCAT activity in comparison to wild-type plants. PDAT1-overexpressing lines’ rosettes also present twice as high expression of LPCAT2 in comparison to control.

Here, we apply fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to quantify telomeric repeat sequences in the NMR, the Damaraland mole-rat, Fukomys damarensis (DMR) and the Mahali mole-rat, Cryptomys hottentotus mahali (MMR). Both terminal and non-terminal telomeric sequences were identified in chromosomes of the NMR and DMR, whilst the MMR displayed only terminal telomeric repeats. Measurements of tooth wear and eruption patterns in wild caught DMRs and MMRs, and known ages in captive bred NMRs, were used to place individuals into relative age classes and compared with a quantitative measure of telomeric fluorescence (as a proxy for telomere size). While NMRs and MMRs failed to show an age-related decline in telomeric fluorescence, the DMR had a significant decrease in fluorescence with age, suggesting a decrease in telomere size in older animals.

Methods: A randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT) was conducted with partially dentate adults aged 65 years or older. Each patient from the RDP group had all missing natural teeth replaced with cobalt–chromium framework RDPs. Each patient from the SDA group was restored to 10 occluding pairs of natural and replacement teeth using RBB. Patients were followed-up at 6, 12, 24, 36 months. Success rates were generated according to defined success criteria. Log-rank tests and Cox's proportional hazard models were used to compare the success of the two treatment strategies. Results: After 36 months, 89 patients completed the RCT; n = 45 in the RDP group and n = 44 in the SDA group. The overall success rate of the SDA treatment was 90.4% compared to 73.0% for RDPs (p = 0.005). In the upper arch SDA treatment was 100% successful compared to 86.4% for RDPs (p = 0.019). In the lower arch, lower success rates were reported for both the SDA treatment (80.0%) and RDPs (60.0%) (p = 0.054). Further analyses with cox's proportional hazard models demonstrated that SDA treatment was significantly more successful than RDPs (Hazard Ratio: 2.47, p = 0.04). Conclusions: After 36 months SDA treatment using RBB was significantly more successful than RDPs used for conventional full-arch rehabilitation in partially dentate older adults.

However, while empirical evidence of actuarial senescence in vertebrates is accumulating in the wild and life history correlates of actuarial senescence are increasingly identified, both the extent and variation of reproductive senescence across species remain poorly studied. Here, we performed the first large-scale analysis of female reproductive senescence across 101 mammalian species that encompassed a wide range of Orders. We found evidence of reproductive senescence in 68.31 % of the species, which demonstrates that reproductive senescence is pervasive in mammals. As expected from allometric rules, the onset of reproductive senescence occurs later and the rate of reproductive senescence decreases with increasing body mass and delayed age at first reproduction. Moreover, for a given pace of life, females displaying a high level of multiple mating and/or with induced ovulation senesce earlier than females displaying a low level of multiple mating and/or with spontaneous ovulation. These results suggest that both female mating behavior and reproductive physiology shape the diversity of reproductive senescence patterns across mammals.

Further, in cooperatively breeding species, in addition to parental ages, the age of ‘helpers’ attending offspring may also affect juvenile performance. Using a 30-year study of a cooperative breeder with very high rates of extra-pair paternity, the superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus), we investigated the effects of maternal, paternal and helper ages on three measures of offspring performance: nestling weight, juvenile survival to independence and recruitment to the breeding population. Mothers with a longer lifespan had offspring with higher juvenile survival, indicating selective disappearance, but the effect of maternal age on juvenile survival was of similar magnitude but negative. For extra-pair offspring, there was no evidence of any effect of the ages of either the genetic sire or the cuckolded ‘social’ father. However, for within-pair offspring, there was a positive effect of paternal age on juvenile survival, which we suggest may be driven by sexual selection. There were positive associations between the average age of helpers attending a nest and two of the three aspects of offspring performance; these effects were stronger than any of the effects of parental age. In general, the multiple associations between offspring fitness and the ages of adults around them appeared to be driven more by age-related changes in environmental effects than by age-related changes in the germline. © 2020 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Female survival slightly increased with date of emergence and slightly decreased with age, while male survival considerably declined with age. Mean life span of females (12.7 days) was ~50% higher than that of males (8.5 days), but two times higher if only the oldest 5% of each sex was considered (39 vs.19 days). Abundance of females (358 ± 14) and males (359 ± 11) was similar, but peak abundance of males preceded that of females by 11 days. Our results suggest that senescence is much more rapid in males than in females in this butterfly, which is in agreement with sexual selection theory.

Currently, age estimation in dugong carcasses relies on counting dentin growth layer groups (GLGs) in tusks, but a disadvantage is they need to be intact. We explored whether measures of telomere length could be used as an alternative approach to age estimation in dugongs given that in other species, telomere length and age are inversely related. In this study, relative telomere length (rTL) was measured by qPCR in skin samples from 24 dugongs of varying ages determined by counts of GLGs. In addition, relationships between age by GLG counts and body weight and length and were examined. Our findings indicate that age estimated by GLGs was negatively correlated with telomere length using the logistic formula with a rate of telomere attrition of approximately 0.036 rTL/year between the ages of 5–20 years. By comparison, both body weight and length were positively correlated with GLG-based age, with growth rates of ~8.8 kg/year for weight and ~3.58 cm/year for length, respectively. After that, growth rates slowed substantially and then plateaued. The results suggest that physical maturity in dugongs occurs at 20 years of age and that measures of rTL might serve as a tool for age estimation in dugongs, living and deceased.

Our results showed that daily survival rate was positively associated with nest age for Laughing Dove and Eurasian Collared Dove, whereas a cubic trend was found for European Turtle Dove. Furthermore, daily survival rate of Laughing Doves was associated negatively with nest height and positively with distance to cereal crops. The beginning of the incubation phase is a critical period for nest survival in the three sympatric Columbidae species. However, in the European Turtle Dove, a second period of vulnerability was recorded between the end of the incubation phase and the beginning of the nestling phase, i.e. between day 11 and 18 of the 30-day nesting cycle. Overall, the highest daily survival rates were recorded for Laughing Doves (0.970 ± 0.006 SE) and European Turtle Doves (0.960 ± 0.005), whereas the lowest (0.937 ± 0.004) was found for Eurasian Collared Doves. Laughing doves and, to a lesser degree, European Turtle Doves are better adapted to conditions prevailing in North African Date Palm plantations.

At the individual level, an early-life improvement in breeding performance may be associated with experience acquired during early reproductive events (experience hypothesis). At the population level, higher average reproductive success of older age cohorts can result from a disappearance of low-quality individuals from the population (selection hypothesis). Here, we tested these hypotheses in a wild population of the Mute Swan Cygnus olor from central Poland. In 1996–2016, we collected information on breeding success of 150 marked individuals (70 females and 80 males; 590 breeding attempts). At the population level, there was an initial increase in reproductive success (1–5 years), followed by a plateau (5–8 years), and then by a decrease in older age classes. Both within- and between-individual age variation contributed to the linear increase in reproductive success at the population level, but the latter effect was much more apparent. Short-term breeders (≤ 2 breeding events) had significantly lower reproductive success than long-term breeders (≥ 3 breeding events) during their first two breeding attempts, providing support for selection hypothesis and disappearance of low-quality phenotypes. After exclusion of short-term breeders, a positive age-related increase in reproductive success lost significance, suggesting that under-specific condition (rapid population growth and strong human disturbance) experience may have a limited effect on reproductive success in long-lived species with strong pair bonds, such as the Mute Swan. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088500980

A previous study found that female small tree finches (Camarhynchus parvulus) preferred pairing with old males and had a higher breeding success when paired with old males because their nests were more concealed, higher up in the canopy and therefore less likely to be depredated. However, causes for brood loss have changed over the last decade: predation of small tree finch nests has decreased, whereas brood losses due to parasitism by the invasive parasitic fly Philornis downsi have increased. In the present study, we investigated (a) how the change in predation and parasitism by P. downsi influenced the breeding success of small tree finches, (b) whether there were still differences in breeding success between young and old males, (c) whether P. downsi infestation had a differential effect on nests of young and old males and (d) whether young and old males differed in foraging success. During 2012–2016, we found an overall low influence of predation and a high influence of P. downsi, but neither differed between nests of young and old males. Nests of old males had more fledglings than those of young males. However, the difference in breeding success disappeared when P. downsi numbers were experimentally reduced by injecting an insecticide into nests. This indicates that older males were able to compensate for the detrimental effects of parasitism. © 2020 The Authors.

This unique study includes post-mortem spinal cord tissue from 64 cases of SCI (at cervical or high-thoracic levels) and 38 control cases without CNS injury.

The results of this study indicate that age at the SCI onset does not adversely affect the cellular inflammatory response to, oligodendroglial apoptosis and axonal survival after SCI. These results support the conclusion that elderly individuals have similar neurobiological responses to SCI as younger people and, hence, treatment decisions should be based on an assessment of the individual patient and not an arbitrary assumption that “advanced age” should exclude patients with an acute SCI from access to advanced care and translational therapies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087982349

However, while multiple studies have demonstrated the presence of social learning in different species across several taxa, less attention has been paid to explaining variation in this phenomenon between populations or individuals. Theoretical modelling has suggested age should be important, with social learning most adaptive during the juvenile phase. Yet, empirical studies testing the interaction between age and social learning are equivocal and scattered in the literature. Accordingly, we present here what we believe to be the first meta-analytical review of this body of work. Collating 57 experimental studies that tested social learning in a foraging context, we conducted a two-fold analysis. First, we examined whether learning success or rates were correlated with five possible variables: phylogeny, dispersal system, age at first reproduction (a conservative measure of extended juvenile periods), type of task or testing condition (captive individuals, wild individuals or wild individuals brought into captivity for testing). Second, we tested for interactions between age and these variables (28 studies). Our results did not support a clear direct relationship between age and social learning abilities. However, life history factors indirectly related to age (age at first reproduction and dispersal system) affected social learning propensity. Finally, social learning success was also correlated with factors related to the experiment itself (captive or wild origin of the animals and the type of task used to assess social learning). © 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088972125

For many long-lived species, such as bats, a lack of external and morphological indicators has made determining age a challenge, leading researchers to examine genetic markers of age for application to demographic studies. One widely studied biomarker of age is telomere length, which has been related both to chronological and biological age across taxa, but only recently has begun to be studied in bats. We assessed telomere length from the DNA of known-age and minimum known-age individuals of two bat species using a quantitative PCR assay. We determined that telomere length was quadratically related to chronological age in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), although it had little predictive power for accurate age determination of unknownage individuals. The relationship was different in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), where telomere length instead was correlated with biological age, apparently due to infection and wing damage associated with whitenose syndrome. Furthermore, we showed that wing biopsies currently are a better tissue source for studying telomere length in bats than guano and buccal swabs; the results from the latter group were more variable and potentially influenced by storage time. Refinement of collection and assessment methods for different non-lethally collected tissues will be important for longitudinal sampling to better understand telomere dynamics in these long-lived species. Although further work is needed to develop a biomarker capable of determining chronological age in bats, our results suggest that biological age, as reflected in telomere length, may be influenced by extrinsic stressors such as disease. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

Despite much recent interest given to describing this phenomenon, its distribution across animal species is poorly understood. A review of the published literature finds that maternal age affects pre-adult survival in 252 of 272 populations (93%) representing 97 animal species. Age effects tended to be deleterious in invertebrates and mammals, including humans, confirming the presence of senescence. However, bird species were a conspicuous exception, as pre-adult survival tended to increase with maternal age in surveyed populations. In all groups, maternal-age effects became more negative in older mothers. Invertebrates senesced faster than vertebrates, and humans aged faster than non-human mammals. Within invertebrates, lepidopterans demonstrated the most extreme rates of maternal-effect senescence. Among the surveyed studies, phylogeny, life history and environment (e.g. laboratory versus wild populations) were tightly associated; this made it difficult to make confident inferences regarding the causes of diversity for the phenomenon. However, we provide some testable suggestions, and we observe that some differences appear to be consistent with predictions from evolutionary theory. We discuss how future work may help clarify ultimate and proximate causes for this diversity. © 2020 The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089360184

Natural exon skipping observed in several DMD cases can help in identifying novel therapeutic tools. Here, we show a DMD study case where the lack of a splicing factor (Celf2a), which results in exon skipping and dystrophin rescue, is due to a maternally inherited trans-generational epigenetic silencing. We found that the study case and his mother express a repressive long non-coding RNA, DUXAP8, whose presence correlates with silencing of the Celf2a coding region. We also demonstrate that DUXAP8 expression is lost upon cell reprogramming and that, upon induction of iPSCs into myoblasts, Celf2a expression is recovered leading to the loss of exon skipping and loss of dystrophin synthesis. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9 inactivation of the splicing factor Celf2a was proven to ameliorate the pathological state in other DMD backgrounds establishing Celf2a ablation or inactivation as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. © 2020 The Authors.

We directly compared dislocated hips treated with closed reduction (CR) to those treated with open reduction and Salter innominate osteotomy (OR/IO) to estimate the relative hazard of total hip arthroplasty (THA) and the THA-free survival time. METHODS: In a series of patients 18 to 60 months of age, 45 patients (58 hips) underwent CR and 58 patients (78 hips) were treated with OR/IO and followed to a minimum 40 years post-reduction. Observations in the survival analysis were censored if no THA had occurred by 48 years. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard of THA given treatment, age, and bilaterality. Complications and additional procedures were noted. RESULTS: At 48 years of follow-up, 29 (50%) of the hips survived after CR compared with 54 (69%) after OR/IO. At 45 years, the survival probability after OR/IO was 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50 to 0.78) compared with 0.55 (95% CI = 0.43 to 0.72) after CR. The hazard ratio (HR) of THA was modeled as a function of treatment, age at reduction, and bilaterality. The effect of age and treatment on the outcome of hips in patients with unilateral involvement was minimal. However, age did significantly alter the relationship between treatment and outcome in bilateral cases. In the bilateral group, the predicted HR of THA was lower after CR in hips that were reduced at the age of 18 months (HR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.64) but higher in those that were reduced at 36 months (HR = 4.23, 95% CI = 2.00 to 8.95). Additional procedures were indicated for 17% and 22% of hips after CR and OR/IO, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoarthritis and THA was more likely after CR than OR/IO, but the data do not indicate a difference in unadjusted hip-survival time. In patients with bilateral disease, an older age at reduction was associated with an increased hazard of THA after CR than after OR/IO. Both treatments provided substantial benefit relative to the natural history of DDH, but THA is the expected outcome in middle adulthood. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

However, numerous epigenetic clocks that may capture distinct aspects of aging have been developed. This study tested the hypothesis that altered aging in SZ manifests in these other clocks. Methods: We performed a comprehensive analysis of 14 epigenetic clocks categorized according to what they were trained to predict: chronological age, mortality, mitotic divisions, or telomere length. To understand the etiology of biological age differences, we also examined DNA methylation predictors of smoking, alcohol, body mass index, serum proteins, and cell proportions. We independently analyzed 3 publicly available multiethnic DNA methylation data sets from whole blood, a total of 567 SZ cases and 594 nonpsychiatric controls. Results: All data sets showed accelerations in SZ for the 3 mortality clocks up to 5 years, driven by smoking and elevated levels of 6 age-associated proteins. The 2 mitotic clocks were decelerated in SZ related to antitumor natural killer and CD8T cells, which may help explain conflicting reports about low cancer rates in epidemiological studies of SZ. One cohort with available medication data showed that clozapine is associated with male-specific decelerations up to 7 years in multiple chronological age clocks. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the utility of studying the various epigenetic clocks in tandem and highlights potential mechanisms by which mental illness influences long-term outcomes, including cancer and early mortality. © 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081957663

The main outcome of this first long-term transgenerational assay is that the exposure of spawners during a single gametogenesis cycle (3 weeks) could result in severe cascading effects on the life-history traits along three unexposed offspring generations (one year). Indeed, we observed a decrease in F1 reproductive success, an early onset of F2 offspring puberty with reduced investment in egg yolk reserves, and finally a decrease in the growth rate of F3 juveniles. However, the analysis of these major transgenerational effects by means of a Lefkovitch matrix population model revealed only weak demographic impacts. Population compensatory processes mitigating the demographic consequences of parental exposure seem to drive the modification of life-history traits in offspring generations.

Adults often show higher reproductive success than their young conspecifics, especially in long-lived bird species, and this may be explained by the cumulative effects of an increase in reproductive experience and the selection of high-quality individuals from one year to the next. To test whether this pattern also exists in short-lived bird species, we used 13 years of monitoring data from two Great Tit Parus major populations. The effects of male and female age on several reproductive parameters were analysed in 419 pairs of Great Tits, while accounting for body condition and infection by haemosporidian parasites. Reproductive success was mainly affected by the age-class of males. Pairs containing a sub-adult male fledged one-third fewer chicks than pairs containing an adult male. The difference was not caused by variation in male fertility but could have been caused by better parental care provided by adult birds. In addition to lower reproductive success, first-year males also had reduced access to mating compared with adult males, suggesting an avoidance of sub-adult males by females. Nestling body condition was positively correlated with parental body condition, and the body condition of male and female members of breeding pairs was positively correlated. Finally, the number of fledged chicks was mainly affected by the infection status of males. These results temper our previously published results showing an effect of infection on Great Tit reproduction regardless of their sex.

In our analysis, we considered three cohorts for which whole-blood DNAm data were available: heat pain sensitivity (HPS), including 20 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for heat pain temperature threshold; fibromyalgia (FM), including 24 cases and 20 controls; and headache, including 22 chronic migraine and medication overuse headache patients (MOH), 18 episodic migraineurs (EM), and 13 healthy subjects. We used the Horvath's epigenetic age calculator to obtain DNAm-based estimates of epigenetic age, telomere length, levels of 7 proteins in plasma, number of smoked packs of cigarettes per year, and blood cell counts. We did not find differences in epigenetic age acceleration, calculated using five different epigenetic clocks, between subjects discordant for pain-related phenotypes. Twins with high HPS had increased CD8+ T cell counts (nominal p = 0.028). HPS thresholds were negatively associated with estimated levels of GDF15 (nominal p = 0.008). FM patients showed decreased naive CD4+ T cell counts compared with controls (nominal p = 0.015). The severity of FM manifestations expressed through various evaluation tests was associated with decreased levels of leptin, shorter length of telomeres, and reduced CD8+ T and natural killer cell counts (nominal p < 0.05), while the duration of painful symptoms was positively associated with telomere length (nominal p = 0.034). No differences in DNAm-based estimates were detected for MOH or EM compared with controls. In summary, our study suggests that HPS, FM, and MOH/EM do not show signs of epigenetic age acceleration in whole blood, while HPS and FM are associated with DNAm-based estimates of immunological parameters, plasma proteins, and telomere length. Future studies should extend these observations in larger cohorts. © Copyright © 2020 Kwiatkowska, Bacalini, Sala, Kaziyama, de Andrade, Terlizzi, Giannini, Cevoli, Pierangeli, Cortelli, Garagnani and Pirazzini.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087013611

One of the current challenges is the investigation of senescence of multiple fitness components and the study of differences between sexes. Until now, studies have been more frequently conducted on females than on males and rather in long-lived than in short-lived species. To reach a more fundamental understanding of the evolution of senescence, it is critical to investigate age-specific survival and reproduction performance in both sexes and in a large range of species with contrasting life histories. In this study, we present results on patterns of age-specific and sex-specific variation in survival and reproduction in the whinchat Saxicola rubetra, a short-lived passerine. We compiled individual-based long-term datasets from seven populations that were jointly analyzed within a Bayesian modeling framework. We found evidence for senescence in survival with a continuous decline after the age of 1 year, but no evidence of reproductive senescence. Furthermore, we found no clear evidence for sex effects on these patterns. We discuss these results in light of previous studies documenting senescence in short-lived birds. We note that most of them have been conducted in populations breeding in nest boxes, and we question the potential effect of the nest boxes on the shape of age-reproductive trajectories. © 2020 The Authors.

Here, we propose to distil the myriad of information embedded in tree-ring time series into a set of tree-ring-based phenotypic traits to be investigated as potential drivers of reproductive success in forest trees. By using a cross-disciplinary approach that combines parentage analysis and a thorough dendrophenotypic characterisation of putative parents, we assessed sex-specific relationships between such dendrophenotypic traits (i.e., age, growth rate and parameters describing sensitivity to climate and to extreme climatic events) and reproductive success in Norway spruce. We applied a full probability method for reconstructing parent–offspring relationships between 604 seedlings and 518 adult trees sampled within five populations from southern and central Europe. We found that individual female and male reproductive success was positively associated with tree growth rate and age. Female reproductive success was also positively influenced by the correlation between growth and the mean temperature of the previous vegetative season. Overall, our results showed that Norway spruce individuals with the highest fitness are those who are able to keep high-growth rates despite potential growth limitations caused by reproductive costs and climatic limiting conditions. Identifying such functional links between the individual ecophysiological behaviour and its evolutionary gain would increase our understanding on how natural selection shapes the genetic composition of forest tree populations over time. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082702447

These chromosomes can in theory spread rapidly in populations and cause extinction, but many are found as balanced polymorphisms or as “cryptic” XDs shut down by drive suppressors. The relative likelihood of these outcomes and the evolutionary pathways through which they come about are not well understood. An XD was recently discovered in the mycophagous fly, Drosophila testacea, presenting the opportunity to compare this XD with the well-studied XD of its sister species, Drosophila neotestacea. Comparing features of independently evolved XDs in young sister species is a promising avenue towards understanding how XDs and their counteracting forces change over time. In contrast to the XD of D. neotestacea, we find that the XD of D. testacea is old, with its origin predating the radiation of three species: D. testacea, D. neotestacea and their shared sister species, Drosophila orientacea. Motivated by the suggestion that older XDs should be more deleterious to carriers, we assessed the effect of the XD on both male and female fertility. Unlike what is known from D. neotestacea, we found a strong fitness cost in females homozygous for the XD in D. testacea: a large proportion of homozygous females failed to produce offspring after being housed with males for several days. Our male fertility experiments show that although XD male fertility is lower under sperm-depleting conditions, XD males have comparable fertility to males carrying a standard X chromosome under a free-mating regime, which may better approximate conditions in wild populations of D. testacea. Lastly, we demonstrate the presence of autosomal suppression of X chromosome drive. Our results provide support for a model of XD evolution where the dynamics of young XDs are governed by fitness consequences in males, whereas in older XD systems, both suppression and fitness consequences in females likely supersede male fitness costs. © 2020 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

While many studies have investigated the ecotoxicological effects of silver (Ag) NPs, the majority focus on “pristine” Ag NPs in simple exposure media, rather than investigating realistic environmental exposure scenarios with transformed NPs. Here, the effects of “pristine” and “aged” Ag NPs are systematically evaluated with different surface coatings on Daphnia magna over four generations, comparing continuous exposure versus parental only exposure to assess recovery potential for three generations. Biological endpoints including survival, growth and reproduction and genetic effects associated with Ag NP exposure are investigated. Parental exposure to “pristine” Ag NPs has an inhibitory effect on reproduction, inducing expression of antioxidant stress related genes and reducing survival. Pristine Ag NPs also induce morphological changes including tail losses and lipid accumulation associated with aging phenotypes in the heart, abdomen, and abdominal claw. These effects are epigenetic remaining two generations post-maternal exposure (F2 and F3). Exposure to identical Ag NPs (same concentrations) aged for 6 months in environmentally realistic water containing natural organic matter shows considerably reduced toxicological effects in continuously exposed generations and to the recovery generations. © 2020 The Authors.

Other studies have reported that shearing at early pregnancy influences the development of the placenta and lamb live weight at birth. However, there was a lack of information on the effect of early-prepartum shearing on the behavior of the offspring from weaning onward. This study evaluated the effect of shearing ewes at 50 days of gestation on the growth, reproductive behavior and response to a gastrointestinal parasite challenge in the female offspring from weaning to 18 months old. Fifty-seven Polwarth female lambs were used, 22 being singles and 35 twins born to ewes either shorn at 50 days of pregnancy (PS, n = 23) or shorn at 62 days postpartum (U, control, n = 34) resulting in four subgroups: single lambs born to PS ewes (n = 8), born to U ewes (n = 14), twin lambs born to PS ewes (n = 15) or born to U ewes (n = 20). All progeny were managed together under improved pasture with a minimum forage allowance of 6% live weight on dry basis. Body weight, body condition score and fecal eggs count were recorded every 14 days from weaning to 18 months of age. Concentrations of progesterone were measured weekly (from 4 to 10 months of age and from 14 to 18 months of age) to establish the onset of puberty. Ovulation rate at an induced and a natural heat (545 ± 1.0 and 562 ± 1.0 day old) was recorded. Prepartum shearing did not affect the age at puberty or the ovulation rate of female offspring, but those born as singles were more precocious ( P = 0.03) and heavier ( P = 0.02) at puberty than twin born lambs. Both the average value of parasite egg count ( P = 0.0 7) and the Famacha index ( P = 0.02) for the entire study period were lower in lambs born to prepartum shorn ewes than those born to postpartum shorn ewes. In conclusion, shearing at 50 days of gestation did not affect the growth or the reproductive behavior of female offspring. However, female lambs born from ewe shorn during gestation showed a better response to the parasitic challenge, and further research is required to confirm this. © 2019 The Animal Consortium.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081990468

Previous comparative analyses revealed that both age at the onset of senescence and rates of senescence are linked to position of a species along the fast–slow life-history continuum.

In this paper, we examined how population position along the fast–slow life-history continuum affects intraspecific variation in senescence in an amphibian, Bombina variegata. We used capture–recapture data collected in four populations with contrasting life-history strategies. Senescence trajectories were analysed using Bayesian capture–recapture models. We show that in populations with fast life histories the onset of actuarial senescence was earlier and individuals aged at a faster rate than individuals in populations with slow life histories. Our study provides one of the few empirical examples of among-population variation in actuarial senescence patterns in the wild and confirms that the fast–slow life-history gradient is associated with both macroevolutionary and microevolutionary patterns of actuarial senescence. © 2020 British Ecological Society",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080026872

In wild populations of some species, including murid rodents, lifespans are substantially modified by environmental signals that affect an individual’s response to such challenges as unfavourable climatic conditions, parasitic load etc. But the real impact of ageing on natural mortality of most species remains obscure. To clarify how age affects the responsiveness of organisms to environmental challenges, we performed longitudinal laboratory observations of wild-derived northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus). We fixed individual longevity and measured metabolic indexes (basal and maximal metabolic rates), ability to maintain body temperature under acute cooling, plasma corticosterone, indexes of acquired and innate immunity in the same individuals of 3–4, 6–7 and 9–10 months old. The maximum estimated lifespan was about 2 years 8 months, which is considerably older than in nature, but less than 30% of individuals passed the one-year milestone. Regardless of the intense mortality, in the first year of life, animals did not demonstrate any age-related deterioration in physiological functions, except leucocyte number. No consistency in any individual physiological index was found. As the individual longevity of red-backed voles varied between years of captivity, we suggest that the welfare and lifespan of wild animals in captivity may be affected by the environmental conditions in the period preceding removal of the animal from the wild. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074439140

In the present study, we focus on how maternal age influences offspring life-history trajectories and performance in a long-lived mammal. We use a multigenerational demographic dataset of semi-captive Asian elephants to investigate maternal age effects on several offspring life-history traits: condition, reproductive success and overall survival. We show that offspring born to older mothers display reduced overall survival but higher reproductive success, and reduced survival of their own progeny. Our results show evidence of a persistent effect of maternal age on fitness across generations in a long-lived mammal.

Recently, DNA methylation profiles have been developed for determining “epigenetic age,” which is the most accurate estimate of biological age. Subsequently, two refined measures of epigenetic age acceleration have been expanded for blood samples as intrinsic and extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA and EEAA, respectively). IEAA involves pure epigenetic aging independent of blood cell composition, whereas EEAA involves immunosenescence in association with blood cell composition. Methods: We investigated epigenetic age acceleration using two independent DNA methylation datasets: a brain dataset from 16 suicide completers and 15 non-psychiatric controls and a blood dataset compiled using economical DNA pooling technique from 56 suicide completers and 60 living healthy controls. In the blood dataset, we considered IEAA and EEAA, as well as DNA methylation-based blood cell composition. Results: There was no significant difference in universal epigenetic age acceleration between suicide completers and controls in both brain and blood datasets. Blood of suicide completers exhibited an increase in EEAA, but not in IEAA. We additionally found that suicide completers had more natural killer cells but fewer granulocytes compared to controls. Conclusion: This study provides novel evidence for accelerated extrinsic epigenetic aging in suicide completers and for the potential application of natural killer cells as a biomarker for suicidal behavior. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075153228

These quantitative traits exhibit variation in natural populations due to the segregation of many interacting loci and from environmental effects. Due to the complexity of the genetic control of lifespan and senescence, our understanding of the genetic basis of variation in these traits is incomplete. Here, we analyzed the pattern of genetic divergence between long-lived (O) Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for postponed reproductive senescence and unselected control (B) lines. We quantified the productivity of the O and B lines and found that reproductive senescence is maternally controlled. We therefore chose 57 candidate genes that are expressed in ovaries, 49 of which have human orthologs, and assessed the effects of RNA interference in ovaries and accessary glands on lifespan and reproduction. All but one candidate gene affected at least one life history trait in one sex or productivity week. In addition, 23 genes had antagonistic pleiotropic effects on lifespan and productivity. Identifying evolutionarily conserved genes affecting increased lifespan and delayed reproductive senescence is the first step toward understanding the evolutionary forces that maintain segregating variation at these loci in nature and may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention to delay senescence while increasing lifespan. © 2020 Parker et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081945691

Two small molecules increased C. elegans' stress resistance, and at least 9 extended their lifespan by ~10-50%. We further evaluated a chalcone that produced relatively large effects on lifespan and were able to implicate the activity of two, stress-response regulators, NRF2/skn-1 and SESN/sesn-1, in its mechanism of action. Our findings suggest that screening for increased stress resistance in human cells can enrich for compounds with promising pro-longevity effects. Further characterization of these compounds may reveal new ways to extend healthy human lifespan.

Genetic differences and epigenetic inflexibility resulting in abnormal gene expression, differential or aberrant methylation patterns account for the vast majority of diseases. The expanding understanding of biological evolution and the environmental influence on epigenetics and natural selection requires relearning of once thought to be well-understood concepts. This research explores the potential for natural modulation by the less understood epigenetic modifications such as ubiquitination, nitrosylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and serotonylation concluding that the under-appreciated acetylation and mitochondrial dependant downstream epigenetic post-translational modifications may be the pinnacle of the epigenomic hierarchy, essential for optimal health, including sustainable cellular energy production. With an emphasis on lessons learned, this conceptional exploration provides a fresh perspective on methylation, demonstrating how increases in environmental methane drive an evolutionary down regulation of endogenous methyl groups synthesis and demonstrates how epigenetic mechanisms are cell-specific, making supplementation with methyl cofactors throughout differentiation unpredictable. Interference with the epigenomic hierarchy may result in epigenetic inflexibility, symptom relief and disease concomitantly and may be responsible for the increased incidence of neurological disease such as autism spectrum disorder. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097784919

Nest-site selection by marsh-nesting birds often involves nest concealment and water depth as key features influencing nest survival. Marsh Harrier (Circus aeruginosus) is an obligate ground nester, which sets it apart from other raptors. The aim of the present study was to identify for the first time possible temporal and habitat factors affecting nest survival in Marsh Harrier. Understanding features which affect nest survival are essential for assessing relevant conservation strategies. Methods: To understand the relative contributions of different temporal and habitat variables to brood losses, it is useful to determine the daily survival rate (DSR). We examined 82 Marsh Harrier nests located on fishponds in eastern Poland, where predation is the main cause of nest loss. Six habitat variables were measured for each active nest. DSR was calculated using known-fate models with the RMark package. Results: The best-supported model predicted that DSR decreased with nest age and was positively affected by the water depth and the diameter of reed stems, but not by the height or density of vegetation at the nest site. The distances of nests to the fishpond dyke and to open water received no support in the models. The chances of nest survival were lower if a neighbouring nest had been depredated. This result suggests that the Marsh Harrier is more susceptible to mammalian than avian predation and confirms the high level of predator pressure in fishpond habitats.

To investigate this question, we exposed the water flea Daphnia magna Straus, 1820 and their offspring to either low (15 °C) or high (25 °C) temperature in a crossed factorial design. High parental temperature reduced the age and size at reproductive maturation and resulted in smaller mean clutch size, regardless of offspring temperature. This suggests that parents did not buffer the effects of high temperature on their offspring. However, offspring raised at high temperature that came from parents also raised at high temperature had similar adult body size and longer lifespan than offspring produced by parents exposed to low temperature. As a consequence of these apparent trade-offs, there was no detectable effect of parental temperature on offspring lifetime reproductive success. These results suggest that although transgenerational plasticity could help organisms to cope with stressful changes in their local environment, such effects might be difficult to detect in natural populations due to associated life-history trade-offs. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

It has a wide range of biological activities, including antineoplastic, anti-inflammatory, antiphotoaging, and antioxidative activities. So it would be interesting to know if naringin has an effect on aging and aging-related diseases. We examined the effect of naringin on the aging of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Our results showed that naringin could extend the lifespan of C. elegans. Moreover, naringin could also increase the thermal and oxidative stress tolerance, reduce the accumulation of lipofuscin, and delay the progress of aging-related diseases in C. elegans models of AD and PD. Naringin could not significantly extend the lifespan of long-lived mutants from genes in insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and nutrient-sensing pathways, such as daf-2, akt-2, akt-1, eat-2, sir-2.1, and rsks-1. Naringin treatment prolonged the lifespan of long-lived glp-1 mutants, which have decreased reproductive stem cells. Naringin could not extend the lifespan of a null mutant of the fox-head transcription factor DAF-16. Moreover, naringin could increase the mRNA expression of genes regulated by daf-16 and itself.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our objective was to investigate the impact of prematurity on the ontogenesis of renal corticosteroid pathways, to evaluate its implication in perinatal renal complications and in the emergence of hypertension in adulthood. Swiss CD1 pregnant mice were injected with lipopolysaccharides at 18 days of gestation (E18) to induce prematurity at E18.5. Pups were sacrificed at birth, 7 days and 6 months of life. Second (F2) and third (F3) generations, established by mating prematurely born adult females with wild-type males, were also analyzed. Former preterm males developed hypertension at M6 (P < 0.0001). We found robust activation of renal corticosteroid target gene transcription at birth in preterm mice (αENaC (+45%), Gilz (+85%)), independent of any change in mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid receptor expression. The offspring of the preterm group displayed increased blood pressure in F2 and F3, associated with increased renal Gilz mRNA expression, despite similar MR or GR expression and plasma corticosteroid levels measured by LC-MS/MS. Gilz promoter methylation measured by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-qPCR was reduced with a negative correlation between methylation and expression (P = 0.0106). Our study demonstrates prematurity-related alterations in renal corticosteroid signaling pathways, with transgenerational inheritance of blood pressure dysregulation and epigenetic Gilz regulation up to the third generation.

The antagonistic pleiotropy and the disposable soma theories of senescence predict that there will be life-history trade-offs between performance at early- and late-life stages. Plants show variation in senescence patterns and thus provide an opportunity to evaluate life-history trade-offs and senescence. Many plant species can be easily followed demographically and their environments, resources and allocation to reproduction can be manipulated, which makes them particularly good models to address these questions. We compared the results from 22 studies of plant senescence in the wild and compiled 20 examples of life-history trade-offs in plants. Some of the unique features of plants that may influence senescence patterns and trade-offs in the wild are highlighted through the results. We found all three age-specific patterns: age decline, age improvement and no change with age for plants in the wild. Most species showed an age-dependent decline in at least one trait but, even within a species, the age-specific patterns of traits varied. Results also showed that trade-offs vary across environments and that plants can manipulate their resource pool through increases in photosynthesis, which will influence the manifestation of trade-offs. We conclude that aspects of plant biology including dynamic resource pools, the impact of size, dormancy and below-ground storage may influence both the patterns of senescence and life-history trade-offs. The diversity of plant life forms and life cycles provide a wealth of opportunities to experimentally study senescence in the context of life-history trade-offs.

However, quantifying age-specific survival in wild populations poses significant logistical and statistical challenges. Recent work has helped to alleviate these constraints by demonstrating that age-specific survival can be estimated using mark–recapture data even when age is unknown for all or some individuals. However, previous approaches do not incorporate auxiliary information that can improve age estimates of individuals. We introduce a survival estimator that combines a von Bertalanffy growth model, age-specific hazard functions, and a Cormack-Jolly-Seber mark–recapture model into a single hierarchical framework. This approach allows us to obtain information about age and its uncertainty based on size and growth for individuals of unknown age when estimating age-specific survival. Using both simulated and real-world data for two painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) populations, we demonstrate that this additional information substantially reduces the bias of age-specific hazard rates, which allows for the testing of hypotheses related to aging. Estimating patterns of senescence is just one practical application of jointly estimating survival and growth; other applications include obtaining better estimates of the timing of recruitment and improved understanding of life-history trade-offs between growth and survival. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074412588

Here we show that wdr-5 mutant longevity is itself a transgenerational trait that corresponds with a global enrichment of the heterochromatin factor H3K9me2 over twenty generations. In addition, we find that the transgenerational aspects of wdr-5 mutant longevity require the H3K9me2 methyltransferase MET-2, and can be recapitulated by removal of the putative H3K9me2 demethylase JHDM-1. Finally, we show that the transgenerational acquisition of longevity in jhdm-1 mutants is associated with accumulating genomic H3K9me2 that is inherited by their long-lived wild-type descendants at a subset of loci. These results suggest that heterochromatin facilitates the transgenerational establishment and inheritance of a complex trait. Based on these results, we propose that transcription-coupled H3K4me via COMPASS limits lifespan by encroaching upon domains of heterochromatin in the genome. © 2019, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

Examination of sectioned otoliths revealed that opaque increment formation occurred annually between November and March, coinciding with the species' spawning season. Estimates of maximum age were similar between sexes, with observed ages of 38 and 36 years for females and males, respectively, extending the reported longevity of this species by at least 11 years. Growth differed significantly between sexes, with males reaching greater length at age and greater asymptotic length than females (38.88 v. 31.46 cm fork length (LF). Total mortality for all samples was estimated as 0.13 and was slightly higher for males (0.16) than females (0.11).

We highlighted associations with false discovery rate-adjusted p-values smaller than.05. Genetically determined longer telomere length was associated with lowered risk of coronary heart disease (CHD; OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92–0.98) but raised risk of cancer (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06–1.16). Little evidence for associations were found with parental lifespan, centenarian status of parents, cognitive function, grip strength, sarcopenia, or falls. The results for those aged 60 and older were similar in younger or all participants. Genetically determined telomere length was associated with increased risk of cancer and reduced risk of CHD but little change in other age-related health outcomes.

We tested the hypothesis that the lack of a single muscarinic receptor subtype leads to age-dependent neuron reduction in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Mice with targeted disruption of single muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype genes (M 1 to M 5 ) and wild-type controls were examined at two age categories, 5 and 15 months, respectively. We found no differences in intraocular pressure between individual mouse groups. Remarkably, in 15-month-old mice devoid of the M 1 receptor, neuron number in the retinal ganglion cell layer and axon number in the optic nerve were markedly reduced. Moreover, mRNA expression for the prooxidative enzyme, NOX2, was increased, while mRNA expression for the antioxidative enzymes, SOD1, GPx1 and HO-1, was reduced in aged M 1 receptor-deficient mice compared to age-matched wild-type mice. In line with these findings, the reactive oxygen species level was also elevated in the retinal ganglion cell layer of aged M 1 receptor-deficient mice. In conclusion, M 1 receptor deficiency results in retinal ganglion cell loss in aged mice via involvement of oxidative stress. Based on these findings, activation of M 1 receptor signaling may become therapeutically useful to promote retinal ganglion cell survival. © 2019, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063439851

As an example of a pleiotropic trait, yeast lifespan is influenced by hundreds of interconnected genes. However, no quantitative methods are currently available to infer system-level changes in gene networks during cellular aging. Results: We propose a parsimonious mathematical model of cellular aging based on stochastic gene interaction networks. This network model is made of only non-Aging components: The strength of gene interactions declines with a constant mortality rate. Death of a cell occurs in the model when an essential node loses all of its interactions with other nodes, and is equivalent to the deletion of an essential gene. Stochasticity of gene interactions is modeled using a binomial distribution. We show that the exponential increase of mortality rate over time can emerge from this gene network model during the early stages of aging.We developed a maximal likelihood approach to estimate three lifespan-influencing network parameters from experimental lifespans: T 0, the initial virtual age of the network system; n, the average lifespan-influencing interactions per essential node; and R, the initial mortality rate. We applied this model to yeast mutants with known effects on replicative lifespans. We found that deletion of SIR2, FOB1, and HXK2 considerably altered the initial virtual age but not the average lifespan-influencing interactions per essential node, suggesting that these mutations mainly influence the reliability of gene interactions but not the overall configurations of gene networks.We applied this model to investigate replicative lifespans of yeast natural isolates. We estimated that the average number of lifespan-influencing interactions per essential node is 7.0 (6.1-8) and the average estimated initial virtual age is 45.4 (30.6-74) cell divisions in these isolates. We also found that t 0 could potentially mediate the observed Strehler-Mildvan correlation in yeast natural isolates. Conclusions: Our theoretical model provides a parsimonious interpretation of experimental lifespan data from the perspective of gene networks. We hope that our work will stimulate more interest in developing network models to study aging as a pleiotropic trait. © 2019 The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075422015

There is now compelling evidence that the inheritance of such genetic information is accompanied by additional epigenetic marks, or stable heritable information that is not accounted for by variations in DNA sequence. The reversible nature of epigenetic marks coupled with multiple rounds of epigenetic reprogramming that erase the majority of existing patterns have made the investigation of this phenomenon challenging. However, continual advances in molecular methods are allowing closer examination of the dynamic alterations to histone composition and DNA methylation patterns that accompany development and, in particular, how these modifications can occur in an individual's germline and be transmitted to the following generation. While the underlying mechanisms that permit this form of transgenerational inheritance remain unclear, it is increasingly apparent that a combination of genetic and epigenetic modifications plays major roles in determining the phenotypes of individuals and their offspring. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Information pertaining to transgenerational inheritance was systematically reviewed focusing primarily on mammalian cells to the exclusion of inheritance in plants, due to inherent differences in the means by which information is transmitted between generations. The effects of environmental factors and biological processes on both epigenetic and genetic information were reviewed to determine their contribution to modulating inheritable phenotypes. SEARCH METHODS: Articles indexed in PubMed were searched using keywords related to transgenerational inheritance, epigenetic modifications, paternal and maternal inheritable traits and environmental and biological factors influencing transgenerational modifications. We sought to clarify the role of epigenetic reprogramming events during the life cycle of mammals and provide a comprehensive review of how the genomic and epigenomic make-up of progenitors may determine the phenotype of its descendants. OUTCOMES: We found strong evidence supporting the role of DNA methylation patterns, histone modifications and even non-protein-coding RNA in altering the epigenetic composition of individuals and producing stable epigenetic effects that were transmitted from parents to offspring, in both humans and rodent species. Multiple genomic domains and several histone modification sites were found to resist demethylation and endure genome-wide reprogramming events. Epigenetic modifications integrated into the genome of individuals were shown to modulate gene expression and activity at enhancer and promoter domains, while genetic mutations were shown to alter sequence availability for methylation and histone binding. Fundamentally, alterations to the nuclear composition of the germline in response to environmental factors, ageing, diet and toxicant exposure have the potential to become hereditably transmitted. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The environment influences the health and well-being of progeny by working through the germline to introduce spontaneous genetic mutations as well as a variety of epigenetic changes, including alterations in DNA methylation status and the post-translational modification of histones. In evolutionary terms, these changes create the phenotypic diversity that fuels the fires of natural selection. However, rather than being adaptive, such variation may also generate a plethora of pathological disease states ranging from dominant genetic disorders to neurological conditions, including spontaneous schizophrenia and autism. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Limited energy availability has been hypothesized to suppress testosterone production, particularly during young adulthood when testosterone levels are highest, resulting in a flatter trajectory of age-decline. Energetic constraint, however, is not unique to the evolutionary ecology of humans, and yet significant age-related testosterone decline is observed in numerous species of wild primates. Conversely, human life history is distinguished by extensive bi-parental care and male provisioning. Because fathers show decreased testosterone with parenting effort, we argue that within more naturalistic and evolutionarily relevant ecologies, natural fertility and earlier reproduction suppresses testosterone in emerging adulthood such that a lower relative baseline dictates less age-decline across the remaining lifespan. Methods: We examine men’s testosterone levels as contrasting functions of energetic status and paternal involvement across three traditional populations with substantial variability in men’s nutritional condition and parental investment. Anthropometric and demographic data along with saliva samples were collected from 70 Datoga, 29 Hadza, and 43 Qom men, ages 20–72 years. Results: Population variation in salivary testosterone was greatest at younger ages and patterned so paternal involvement associated with lower morning and evening testosterone, along with diminished age-decline in both measures. Men’s energetic status as indicated by body mass index was not associated with testosterone values or age-related decline. Conclusions: Within socioecological contexts of smaller scale society, these data suggest that blunted age-decline in men’s testosterone levels is primarily due to population variation in parental investment rather than energetic constraint. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074198951

Estimating the relative contribution of environmental factors experienced sequentially during breeding and wintering, and their potential interaction, to the variation of survival is crucial to predict population viability of migratory species. Here we investigated this issue for the Montagu's harrier Circus pygargus, a trans-Saharan migrant. We analysed capture–recapture data from a 29-year long monitoring of wing-tagged offspring and adults at two study sites in France (Rochefort-RO and Maine-et-Loire-ML). The study period covers a climatic shift occurring in the Sahel with increasing rainfall following a period of droughts (Sahel greening). We found that harriers’ adult survival in RO (between 1988 and 2005) varied over time and was sensitive to the interaction between the amount of rainfall in the Sahel and the annual mean breeding success, two proxies of prey availability. The occurrence of adverse conditions on breeding and wintering grounds in the same year decreased survival from 0.70–0.77 to 0.48 ± 0.05. Juvenile survival in RO was slightly more sensitive to conditions in Europe than in the Sahel. Unexpectedly, lower survival rates were found in years with higher mean breeding success, suggesting compensatory density feedbacks may operate. By contrast, adult survival in ML, monitored between 1999 and 2017, was higher compared to RO (0.76 ± 0.03 versus 0.66 ± 0.02), remained constant and unaffected by any proxy of prey availability. This difference seems consistent with the fact that harriers in ML experienced better and especially less variable environmental conditions during breeding and wintering seasons compared to RO. Overall, we showed that survival of a migratory bird is sensitive to the level of variability in environmental conditions and that adverse conditions on wintering grounds can amplify the negative effects of conditions during the previous breeding season on birds’ survival. © 2019 Nordic Society Oikos",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073262881

Herein, we demonstrate that activating transcription factor 7 (ATF7), the stress-responsive recruiter of histone H3K9 di- and trimethyltransferases, functions in the accumulation of Cdk inhibitors. Atf7-deficient (Atf7‒/‒) mice have a shorter lifespan than wild-type (WT) mice. Levels of p16Ink4a Cdk inhibitor mRNA increased with age more rapidly in Atf7‒/‒ mice than in WT animals. ATF7 binds to the p16Ink4a gene promoter and was released with age. Consistently, histone H3K9me2 levels on the p16Ink4a gene promoter were lower in Atf7‒/‒ mice than in WT animals. Similar results were obtained when Atf7‒/‒ and WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured under 20% oxygen conditions, which induces cellular senescence via oxidative stress. Phosphorylation of ATF7 by p38 was also increased with the passage of MEFs, consistent with previous observations that ATF7 phosphorylation by p38 induces its release from chromatin.

In Russia, the low numbers of oak trees in planted stands (about 4500 oaks/ha) are complemented by abundant natural regeneration of admixed tree species. In this study, the chronosequence method was used to determine the probability of survival and the quality development of young oaks (10–27 years) in Tatarstan as a factor of initial plant numbers, interspecific competition (lime, maple, hazel), oak age and tending measures. The results provided by LMM and GLMM models revealed that the probability of oak survival rises with increasing initial oak plant density and tending, and declines with increasing competitive pressure of maple. While the competition exerted by all admixed tree species had a negative effect on oak growth parameters, it had a positive effect on important oak quality parameters (e.g., diameter and height of the thickest branches, branch-free bole length). However, a positive impact of high initial plant density on oak quality was reduced by strong interspecific competition. Age had a positive effect on oak quality development, and tending a negative effect. The findings of this study demonstrate that the competitive pressure of admixed tree species can successfully compensate for the positive effects of oak intraspecific competition on oak quality, and may therefore be exploited by forest managers as a means to reduce the cost of oak establishment by using lower plant numbers without risking any loss of oak quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065874659

Dietary habits constitute the main environmental factor that may accelerate or decelerate this process. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are constituents of dietary products that are consumed daily, such as bread and milk. Although AGEs have been widely regarded as toxic agents, recent studies seem to contradict this view: they either find no adverse effects of AGEs or even attribute beneficial properties to them. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of sugar-derived AGEs on organismal lifespan using as a model the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Exposure to sugar-derived AGEs prolonged the lifespan of wild type animals; this lifespan extension was accompanied by an enhanced pharyngeal pumping rate. We demonstrate that elevation of the pharyngeal pumping rate depends on W06A7.4 and eat-4 expression, as well as on daf-16, which encodes a FOXO family transcription factor. Our results suggest that sugar-derived AGEs modulate the lifespan of C. elegans at least in part through transcriptional regulation of pharyngeal pumping throughout the animals’ lifespan. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Previous work based on a deterministic model claimed that such asymmetry in the partitioning of cell volume and of aging-associated damage confers a fitness benefit in avoiding clonal senescence, primarily by diversifying the cellular population. However, clonal populations of unicellular organisms are already naturally diversified due to the inherent stochasticity of biological processes. Results: Applying a model of aging cells that accounts for natural cell-to-cell variations across a broad range of parameter values, here we show that the parameters directly controlling the accumulation and repair of damage are the most important factors affecting fitness and clonal senescence, while the effects of both segregation of damaged components and division asymmetry are frequently minimal and generally context-dependent.

In adult males, a decrease in the body weight and a reduction of the contribution of lung lesions detected during postmortal autopsy to mortality are detected. In adult females, an increase in the proportion of mice with impaired estrous cycle at the later stages of life and an acceleration of the mortality associated with uterine hemangioma are observed with the absence of any effect of melatonin on the body weight. Changes in the frequency of detection of other tumors are multidirectional: there is a decrease in the frequency in males and an increase in females. The age of death of the last 25% and 10% of males increases, while in females it decreases. An analysis of the complete survivorship curves using the Gompertz model does not reveal changes in the rate of aging and initial mortality sufficient to go beyond the limits determined by the artifact component of the Strehler–Mildvan correlation between these parameters. In general, the tendencies noted in males and females are multidirectional: favorable and unfavorable, respectively. Melatonin is contraindicated for pregnant and nursing women and children under 18 years old. The gender specificity of the effects of melatonin, apparently, should be considered when assessing the feasibility of its prescription to these categories. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073249280

Both Akt and AMPK play an essential role in the maintenance of cardiac homeostasis. This study examined the impact of ablation of Akt2 (the main cardiac isoform of Akt) and AMPKα2 on development of cardiac aging and the potential mechanisms involved with a focus on autophagy. Cardiac geometry, contractile, and intracellular Ca2+ properties were evaluated in young (4-month-old) and old (12-month-old) wild-type (WT) and Akt2-AMPK double knockout mice using echocardiography, IonOptix® edge-detection and fura-2 techniques. Levels of autophagy and mitophagy were evaluated using western blot. Our results revealed that increased age (12 months) did not elicit any notable effects on cardiac geometry, contractile function, morphology, ultrastructure, autophagy and mitophagy, although Akt2-AMPK double knockout predisposed aging-related unfavorable changes in geometry (heart weight, LVESD, LVEDD, cross-sectional area and interstitial fibrosis), TEM ultrastructure, and function (fractional shortening, peak shortening, maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening, time-to-90% relengthening, intracellular Ca2+ release and clearance rate). Double knockout of Akt2 and AMPK unmasked age-induced cardiac autophagy loss including decreased Atg5, Atg7, Beclin1, LC3BII-to-LC3BI ratio and increased p62. Double knockout of Akt2 and AMPK also unmasked age-related loss in mitophagy markers PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1), Parkin, Bnip3, and FundC1, the mitochondrial biogenesis cofactor PGC-1α, and lysosomal biogenesis factor TFEB. In conclusion, our data indicate that Akt2-AMPK double ablation predisposes cardiac aging possibly related to compromised autophagy and mitophagy.

However, the potential transgenerational consequences for adult phenotype are largely unknown. Additionally, the possible impacts of natural hatch/birth order and natal brood composition in unmanipulated broods/litters on adult performance has been understudied. This experiment takes a novel approach to studying developmental stress by integrating and assessing multiple potential stressors and multiple secondary sexual traits simultaneously in order to determine how these influence both social and genetic reproductive success. Male zebra finches were colony-reared on high- or low-quality diets; as adults, they reproduced competitively on an intermediate diet. Male visual ornaments (beak color and cheek patch size) were found to be reliable signals of developmental stress, since they showed high sensitivity to multiple early conditions and predicted reproductive success. Contrary to the nutritional stress hypothesis, early diet did not impact song traits investigated. Male reproductive success was impacted by diet history, male hatch order, and natal brood traits of males' fathers, with daughter and son production sensitive to different subsets of identified reproductive stressors. Notably, diet influenced only son production and the hatch orders of males and their fathers influenced only daughter production. Findings suggest that the sexes respond differently to early life conditions, which may influence subsequent sex allocation patterns. Despite good general correspondence in patterns of social and genetic reproductive success, males that sired 1 or more extra-pair offspring achieved higher fitness through greater son production. © The Author(s) 2019.

A previous study showed that exposure of human and mouse embryos to high maternal thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations not only affects the newborns but also subsequently reduces thyrotroph sensitivity to TH during adult life. The current investigation set out to determine if this epigenetic effect is transmitted by humans not exposed in utero to high TH levels to their offspring. Methods: The study took advantage of the high frequency of intrauterine exposure to high TH in the Azorean wild-type population born to healthy mothers with high TH levels because of a heterozygous TH receptor beta gene mutation. Wild-type individuals from F2 (second) and F3 (third) generations were studied, whose parents and grandparents, respectively, were not exposed to high maternal TH levels. Twenty-six individuals belonging to 17 nuclear families were tested for their sensitivity to TH using their thyrotropin (TSH) response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) after administration of liothyronine (LT3). Results: Preservation of reduced sensitivity to TH (RSTH) was found in descendants of males but not of females with likewise RSTH. In F2, offspring of fathers but not of mothers exposed to high TH levels had RSTH (TRH-stimulated TSH of 6.39 ± 0.63 vs 1.58 ± 0.41 mIU/L [p < 0.001], respectively, after treatment with LT3). In F3, whose parents nor themselves were exposed to TH excess during their fetal life, descendants of fathers and not mothers had RSTH (TRH-stimulated TSH of 4.60 ± 0.61 vs 1.37 ± 0.23 mIU/L [p < 0.01], respectively, after pretreatment with LT3). Conclusions: Since intrauterine total body and gonadal exposure to elevated TH can potentially affect only the F1 and F2, respectively, the results obtained from F3 confirm a true inheritance of an epigenetic effect, scarcely observed in humans. While the exact mechanism underlying the inheritance of this epigenetic effect remains unknown, it correlates with type 3 deiodinase overexpression demonstrated in pituitary glands of mice born to dams with high TH. This enzyme inactivates TH, and is encoded by an imprinted gene with specific parent of origin expression. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066932640

Introduction of an 8-mm passive integrated transponder (PIT) reduced the minimum taggable size of fish, but it has not been evaluated in field trials. We evaluated the growth and survival of age-0 Oncorhynchus mykiss tagged with 8-mm PIT tags in four streams in southwest Washington, USA. Results: A total of 351 PIT tagged fish and 340 control fish (marked with pelvic fin clips) were released, but recapture rates were low, particularly for control fish. Growth in length and mass did not differ between small (42-54 mm) and large (55-64 mm) PIT tagged fish. There was a slightly positive, but weak, relation between tag burden and growth in mass; however, there was considerable variability in this relation (R 2 = 0.115). Summer to autumn joint probability of fish surviving and remaining in the study area estimated with a Bayesian mark-recapture model ranged from 0.228 to 0.478 in study streams. We found no significant relation between tag burden and survival, suggesting neither tag burden nor fish size at tagging affected survival. Conclusions: Although this study was limited in scope, it provided insight into how age-0 O. mykiss tagged with 8-mm PIT tags grew and survived under natural conditions. We showed that fish as small as 42 mm could be tagged without detrimental effects, which should allow researchers to represent a larger portion of study populations through PIT tagging. © 2019 The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065607113

Here, we assessed patterns in reproduction for a small population of endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) over 90 pack years. We tested how availability of prey, pack size, pack density, rainfall, temperature and female age affected the age of first litter, litter size and pup survival. We found that females bred younger when pack density, availability of prey and pack size were large. We also found that fecundity increased significantly with age while the population was male biased only for 1-, 2- and 4-year olds. Larger litters were produced by larger packs, suggesting strong reproductive benefits of grouping related to cooperative hunting and food provisioning for helpers and alpha females. We also found an interaction between breeding female age and pack size where older females in large packs raised a high proportion of pups. Additionally, large litters and large packs were important for raising a greater number of pups to 6 and 12 months, respectively, suggesting that while litter size is important for pup survival, the benefits of a large pack are only realised when pups are older and mobile with the pack. Collectively, these results illustrate the novel finding that prey availability is critically important in initiating reproduction in wild dogs and that the number of non-breeding helpers, female age and litter size is essential to pup survival. Significance statement: Variation in socio-environmental conditions strongly affects reproduction. We studied how the temporal variation in such conditions affected reproduction for African wild dogs across 23 years. We specifically aimed to test how long-term variation in food supply in conjunction with various socio-environmental conditions affected this endangered species’ ability to reproduce and raise offspring. Our result of larger groups producing larger litters and raising more pups strengthens previous conclusions of the critical importance of group size for wild dogs. However, reproduction is strongly dependent on when individuals can first reproduce and, for the first time, we illustrate that prey availability is the lynchpin upon which reproduction is initiated in this endangered species. We also highlight the importance of maternal age and initial large litter sizes in raising pups. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065012092

Due to tag burden (tag mass relative to fish mass) constraints, telemetry studies investigating migration survival have focused on tracking hatchery smolts or larger individuals within wild populations. However, hatchery and larger wild smolts may not represent the majority of migrants. We used miniaturized acoustic transmitters (VEMCO V4) to track age-1 Sockeye Salmon smolts (n = 200) for the first time over approximately 950 km from Chilko Lake, British Columbia, Canada, through the coastal environment by using large-scale receiver arrays. We compared their survival with that of concomitantly tracked age-2 smolts (n = 100) by using VEMCO V7 acoustic transmitters. Freshwater survival of tagged age-1 smolts was double the age-2 survival (56% versus 28%), potentially due to higher proportional tag burdens on age-2 smolts. Age-1 smolt cumulative survival was 16% to the last array capable of detecting age-1 smolts (944 km from release) and was within the range of cumulative survival reported for age-2 Chilko Lake Sockeye Salmon smolts in previous telemetry studies. Age-2 smolt minimum cumulative survival to the final arrays (944 and 1,041 km) was about 2% and was lower than survival in previous years. Although survival differed between age-classes in 2016, both experienced similar trends in landscape-specific survival relative to age-2 smolts tracked in previous years. Survival was particularly low in the upper Fraser River tributaries for age-1 and age-2 smolts (76% and 53%, respectively, over 13 km from release) and after ocean entry for age-1 smolts (36% over 217 km). Migration rates of both age-classes among landscapes were within the range observed for age-2 smolts in earlier studies.

Despite the important role the quail telencephalon plays in filial imprinting and passive avoidance learning, neurogenesis in this structure has been completely overlooked. The aim of this study was therefore to quantitatively determine how DCX expression in the Japanese quail telencephalon changes with post hatching age (3–12 weeks) and life history stage. In this study, DCX was used as a proxy for neuronal incorporation. Bipolar and multipolar DCX immunoreactive cells were observed in the entire telencephalon except for the entopallium and arcopallium. In addition, DCX expression in all the eight telencephalic areas quantified was strongly negatively correlated with post-hatching age. Furthermore, numbers of bipolar and multipolar DCX immunoreactive cells were higher in the juvenile compared to subadult and adult quails.

In the present work, through the deletion of the gene encoding catalase, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) was uncovered as a relevant regulator of longevity and of liver metabolism. Mice lacking catalase (Cat −/− ) fed ad libitum with a regular diet showed a shorter lifespan than wild type mice, which correlated with reduced body weight, blood glucose levels and liver fat accumulation, but not with increased oxidative damage or consistent premature aging. High fat diet (HFD) and fasting increased oxidative damage in the liver of wild type animals but, unexpectedly, this was not the case for that of Cat −/− mice. Interestingly, although HFD feeding similarly increased the body weight of Cat −/− and wild-type mice, hyperglycemia and liver steatosis did not develop in the former. Fat accumulation due to fasting, on the other hand, was diminished in mice lacking catalase, which correlated with increased risk of death and low ketone body blood levels. Alteration in expression of some metabolic genes in livers of catalase deficient mice was consistent with reduced lipogenesis. Specifically, Pparγ2 expression up-regulation in response to a HFD and down-regulation upon fasting was lower and higher, respectively, in livers of Cat −/− than of wild type mice, and a marked decay was observed during Cat −/− mice aging. We propose that catalase regulates lipid metabolism in the liver by an evolutionary conserved mechanism that is determinant of lifespan without affecting general oxidative damage. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062430248

Body mass is associated with organismal functioning in many species, and often changes with age. We here tested in zebra finches whether two factors that decreased lifespan, sex and poor environmental quality, accelerated the onset of body mass declines. We subjected 597 birds for nine years to experimentally manipulated foraging costs (harsh = H, benign = B) during development (small vs large brood size) and in adulthood (easy vs hard foraging conditions) in a 2 × 2 design. This yielded four treatment combinations (HH, HB, BH, BB) for each sex. Harsh environments during development and in adulthood decreased average body mass additively. The body mass aging trajectory showed a short steep increase in early adulthood, followed by a plateau and then a decline after 5 years. This decline occurred in all groups except for HB females, which gained mass until death. Surprisingly, the onset of body mass decline was earlier in experimental groups with a longer lifespan. In contrast, the onset of body mass decline was one year earlier in females, which lived two months (4%) shorter than males. Thus, the onset of body mass aging associated positively with the sex-specific differences in lifespan, but negatively with the environmental modulation of lifespan. Thus, body mass aging trajectories did not generally scale to lifespan, and we discuss the possible causes and implications of this finding. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061205722

Using multiple experimental approaches, we show great tits to have ultralong telomeres, and we investigated age effects on Class II and III telomeres using a longitudinal approach (our method excludes Class I telomeres). In adults, TL averaged over the whole distribution did not significantly change with age. However, more detailed analyses showed that Class II TL did shorten with age, and, as in other species, the longest Class II telomeres within individuals shortened more quickly with age. In contrast, Class III TL did not shorten with age within individual adults. Surprisingly, we found the opposite pattern in nestlings: Class III TL shortened significantly with age, while the age effect on Class II TL was close to zero. Thus, Class III TL may provide information on developmental history, while Class II TL provides information on telomere dynamics in adulthood. These findings have practical implications for telomere studies and raise the interesting question of what causes variation in TL dynamics between chromosomes within individuals and how this is related to development. © 2019 The Authors.

Studies of epigenetic germline inheritance have shown that environmental exposures can induce effects in the offspring without altering the DNA sequence of germ cells. Most mechanistic studies were conducted in laboratory rodents and C.elegans while observational studies confirm the phenotypic phenomenon in wild populations of humans and other species including birds. Prominently, paternal age in house sparrows affects offspring fitness, yet the mechanism is unknown. This study provides a first reference of house sparrow sperm small RNA as an attempt to uncover their role in the transmission of the effects of paternal age on the offspring. In this small-scale pilot, we found no statistically significant differences between miRNA and tRNA fragments in aged and prime sparrow sperm. These results indicate a role of other epigenetic information carriers, such as distinct RNA classes, RNA modifications, DNA methylation and retained histones, and a clear necessity of future studies in wild populations. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

We investigated whether childhood experiences of poor-quality parenting (characterized as decreased parental care and increased parental overprotection) are associated with women's reproductive timing and lifespan. Study design: Observational study of 2383 women aged 55–89 years in 2007 from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Multinomial logistic regression models were estimated. Main outcome measures: Self-reported ages at menarche and menopause and duration of reproductive lifespan. Results: Increasing maternal and paternal overprotection were associated with later menarche (≥16 years) after adjustment for age and childhood socioeconomic position (relative risk ratio (RRR) 1.11, 95% CI 1.02–1.21 and 1.11, 95% CI 1.01–1.21, respectively, per unit increase in the predictor). Increasing parental overprotection and decreasing paternal care were associated with earlier menarche (≤10 years). However, these associations were marginally non-significant. Maternal and paternal overprotection were also inversely associated with age at natural menopause after adjustment for age, childhood socioeconomic position and age at menarche (p value for linear trend = 0.041 and 0.004, respectively). Further, increasing paternal overprotection was associated with a shorter reproductive lifespan (≤33 years) (RRR 1.09 (1.01–1.18), per unit increase in the predictor) after adjustment for age and childhood socioeconomic position. Adjustment for additional childhood and adult factors did not explain these associations. Conclusions: Women who experienced poor-quality parenting in childhood, especially increased levels of parental overprotection, might be at increased risk of an unfavourable reproductive health profile that is characterized by late or early menarche, premature menopause and a shorter reproductive lifespan. © 2019 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060620443

In this study, we aim to investigate survival in patients with and without dementia after PEG-tube placement. Methods: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study in four different hospitals in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we explored the ethical considerations that may play a role in the decision whether or not to insert a PEG tube in a patient with dementia. Results: Three-hundred-and-three patients were included, mean age of 77.4 years. Forty-two (13.9%) patients had dementia. Short-term complications did not differ between patients with and without cognitive disorders (P 0.224). However, patients with dementia survived significantly shorter after PEG placement than did patients without dementia. Adjusted for age and sex, patients with dementia had a 49% increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.01–2.19). In our exploratory literature search, we found that several ethical concerns and considerations play a role in the decision process of PEG placement. These considerations are both medical and nonmedical and include beliefs regarding the benefits of a PEG tube, a lack of knowledge about the natural course of dementia in both professionals and family of patients, and a fear of letting a patient die hungry. Conclusions: Patients with dementia had higher mortality rates after PEG placement than patients without dementia. Although multiple ethical concerns and considerations play a role, insertion of a PEG tube in patients with dementia is not appropriate. © 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059664215

Although the frequency of these diseases increases with aging, the effect of a maternal high-fat diet on aged offspring remains elusive. Main methods: C57BL/6J female mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet or a control (CON) diet and then mated. All offspring remained with their birth dam until weaning at 3 weeks. After weaning, the offspring from the HF and CON diet-fed dams were given either the HF diet or CON diet, which resulted in four groups: CON/CON, CON/HF, HF/CON, and HF/HF. All mice were immunized with ovalbumin and then sacrificed at 70 weeks. Key findings: The body weights in offspring from dam exposed to a HF diet were significantly higher than those in offspring from dam fed a CON diet in the early stage of life but then became lower in the later stage of life. The serum adiponectin levels were lower in offspring from dam exposed to a HF diet and were correlated with adiposity measured by visceral and subcutaneous fat mass. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was much more severe in the livers of offspring from the maternal HF groups. In particular, lobular inflammation and fibrosis were prominent in the HF/HF group. Regarding immunological parameters, senescence-associated T cells were increased, and natural killer T cells were decreased by the effect of both maternal and offspring HF diet. Significance: We have demonstrated that a maternal high-fat diet may accelerate the adipo-immunologic aging process. © 2019",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059894452

Nevertheless, a positive social network has been related to the adequate maintenance of health and deceleration of aging. Adult prematurely aging mice (PAM) are characterized by their inadequate stress response to a T-maze, showing premature immunosenescence and oxidative stress establishment. These impairments contribute to shorter life spans in comparison to exceptional non-PAM (ENPAM). However, it is not known whether these characteristics of PAM could be prevented by a positive cohabitation. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to determine if the premature immunosenescence and oxidative stress shown by PAM could be avoided by the cohabitation with ENPAM, increasing their life span. Female CD1 PAM and ENPAM were divided into three experimental groups: PAM controls, ENPAM controls and a social environment experimental group, containing in the same cage ENPAM and PAM (proportion 5/2, respectively). After 2 months, mice were sacrificed and spleen, thymus, liver and heart removed. Later, several immune functions as well as oxidative stress parameters were assessed in spleen and thymus leukocytes. Also, several oxidative stress parameters were analyzed in liver and heart. The results showed that PAM, after co-housing with ENPAM, had improved immune functions and redox balance in spleen and thymus leukocytes. This improvement of redox state was also observed in liver and heart. Furthermore, all these positive effects seem to be related to the increased life span of PAM. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053841742

However, few studies have explored the dependency of anthropometric characteristics and fitness from age category or the event preferred by gymnasts. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the somatic type, body composition and values of some anthropometric and fitness characteristics and indices of gymnasts according to age and preferred event. A total of 53 male gymnasts (19 seniors and 34 juniors) were examined right before the Polish Senior and Junior Championships in Artistic Gymnastics in Warsaw (May 25 to 28, 2017). We examined the characteristics of body length, skeletal system mass, muscle mass, skinfold thickness, and body mass (Tanita S.C.-330S). Body composition (Durnin and Womersley equations), somatotypes (Heath-Carter methodology), handgrip strength (Takei dynamometer), body balance (UPST), the power of the lower limbs (CMJ) were evaluated. Senior gymnasts presented higher than juniors experience, mesomorphy and had higher values in fitness tests of handgrip strength and power of lower limbs (p<0.05). The specialists in floor exercises and vault characterized in higher mesomorphy and lower ectomorphy (p<0.05) and better results of CMJ (p<0.05). We concluded: The seniors demonstrated natural predominance over juniors in several somatic and fitness variables. Detected differences can be useful in the process of identification and development of gymnastic talent. The detected effect of preferred event on certain variables that characterize body build and physical fitness can be useful for choosing a specialization in gymnastic event. A high skill level in all-around events at a national competitive level can be achieved by an athlete characterized by adequate experience, a mesomorphy somatotype component, lower limb index, pelvi-acromial index and relative HGSmax. © 2019 Sterkowicz-Przybycień et al.

However, the origins of variation in these measures are not well understood. Methods: In a pooled sample of 104 Swedish and Danish twin pairs, we estimated, at the mean age of 70 (baseline) and 79 years (follow-up), the genetic and environmental influences on the Horvath and Levine clocks. Findings: A model incorporating additive genetic (A) and person-specific environmental (E) influences best explained the variation in both clocks. Heritability was estimated at 55% at baseline and at 51% at follow-up for the Horvath clock and 34% at baseline and 41% at follow-up for the Levine clock. For the Horvath clock, new sources of A influences emerged at follow-up, whereas for the Levine clock, the same A influences accounted for the genetic variance at both measurement occasions. The cross-time phenotypic correlations, 0·52 for the Horvath clock and 0·36 for the Levine clock, were mediated primarily by genetic factors, whereas the person-specific environmental factors were completely different at the two measurement occasions. Interpretation: For both clocks, new sources of person-specific environmental influences emerge with age. The epigenetic clocks might thus be responsive to new environmental stimuli even at old age.

To assess the effect of subfertility, the groups were pooled to form a subfertile group, and compared with a prospectively followed fertile reference group (n = 282). The sensitive Minor Neurological Dysfunction (MND) examination was used, resulting in the detailed Neurological Optimality Score (NOS) and the prevalence of the clinically relevant complex MND. Neurological condition of the three subfertile groups did not differ significantly: median NOS was 53 in each subfertile group and the prevalence of complex MND in the three subfertile groups was 30%, 37% and 36%, respectively. However, the NOS was lower and the prevalence of complex MND higher in children born to subfertile couples than in children of fertile couples (adjusted mean difference [95% CI]: −4.48 [−5.53 to −3.42]) and adjusted OR [95% CI]: 5.13 [2.60–10.16], respectively). We conclude that ovarian hyperstimulation, in vitro procedures, and the combination of both were not associated with a less favourable neurological outcome of 9-year-old singletons.

Our results showed that thiamethoxam at doses of 0.1 × LC10 (0.053 mg L−1) and LC10 (0.53 mg L−1) significantly reduced adult emergence, fecundity and fertility of the parental generation. In unexposed progeny (F1) of thiamethoxam-exposed parents, at the two doses 0.1 × LC10 and LC10, the larval stage was prolonged, and total longevity was decreased by 18.76 and 24.46%, respectively.

We now provide evidence that this gradual evolution, the pace of which is contingent on the precise context of the primary response, also impinges on the molecular mechanisms that regulate CD8 + memory T cell (T M ) homeostasis. Over time, CD8 + T M generated in the wake of an acute infection with the natural murine pathogen lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus become more resistant to apoptosis and acquire enhanced cytokine responsiveness without adjusting their homeostatic proliferation rates; concurrent metabolic adaptations promote increased CD8 + T M quiescence and fitness but also impart the reacquisition of a partial effector-like metabolic profile; and a gradual redistribution of aging CD8 + T M from blood and nonlymphoid tissues to lymphatic organs results in CD8 + T M accumulations in bone marrow, splenic white pulp, and, particularly, lymph nodes. Altogether, these data demonstrate how temporal alterations of fundamental homeostatic determinants converge to render aged CD8 + T M poised for greater recall responses.

In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that atypical antipsychotics were associated with a significantly greater mortality risk compared to placebo, which prompted the addition of an FDA black-box warning. The American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) White Paper, 2008, reviewed this issue and made clinical and research recommendations regarding the use of antipsychotics in dementia patients with psychosis and/or agitation. Increased mortality risk has also been described in cerebrovascular adverse events in elderly users of antipsychotics. In the present work, at the translational level, we used male 3xTg-AD mice (PS1M146V, APPSwe, tauP301L) at advanced stages of the disease reported to have worse survival than females, to study the behavioral effects of a low chronic dose of risperidone (0.1 mg/ kg, s.c., 90 days, from 13 to 16 months of age) and its impact on long-term survival, as compared to mice with normal aging. Animals were behaviorally assessed for cognitive and BPSD (behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia)-like symptoms in naturalistic and experimental conditions (open-field test, T-maze, social interaction, Morris water maze, and marble test) before and after treatment. Weight, basal glucose levels, and IPGTT (i.p. glucose tolerance test) were also recorded. Neophobia in the corner test was used for behavioral monitoring. Survival curves were recorded throughout the experiment until natural death. The benefits of risperidone were limited, both at cognitive and BPSD-like level, and mostly restricted to burying, agitation/vibrating tail, and other social behaviors. However, the work warns about a clear early mortality risk window during the treatment and long-lasting impact on survival. Reduced life expectancy and life span were observed in the 3xTg-AD mice, but total lifespan (36 months) recorded in C57BL/6 × 129Sv counterparts with normal aging was also truncated to 28 months in those with treatment. Sarcopenia at time of death was found in all groups, but was more severe in wild-type animals treated with risperidone. Therefore, the 3xTg-AD mice and their non-transgenic counterparts can be useful to delimitate critical time windows and for studying the physio-pathogenic factors and underlying causal events involved in this topic of considerable public health significance.

However, it is unknown which immune cell parameters can predict lifespan and if there would be any changes in this prediction, depending on the age of the subject. Therefore, a longitudinal study in mice was performed analysing immune function (chemotaxis of macrophages and lymphocytes, phagocytosis of macrophages, natural killer (NK) activity, and lymphoproliferation capacity), antioxidant (catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities as well as reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations), oxidant (oxidized glutathione (GSSG), superoxide anion, and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations), and inflammation-related markers (basal release of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10) in peritoneal leukocytes from mice at the adult, mature, old, very old, and long-lived ages (40, 56, 72, 96, and 120 ± 4 weeks of age, respectively). The results reveal that some of the investigated parameters are determinants of longevity at the adult age (lymphoproliferative capacity, lymphocyte chemotaxis, macrophage chemotaxis and phagocytosis, GPx activity, and GSH, MDA, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 concentrations), and therefore, they could be proposed as markers of the rate of aging. However, other parameters are predictive of extreme longevity only at the very old age (NK activity, CAT and GR activities, and IL-6 and IL-1β concentrations), and as such, they could reflect some of the adaptive mechanisms underlying the achievement of high longevity. Nevertheless, although preliminary, the results of the present study provide a new perspective on the use of function, redox, and inflammatory parameters in immune cells as prognostic tools in aging research and represent a novel benchmark for future work aimed at prediction of lifespan.

Based on progressive telomere attrition from naive to late effector memory cells, human CD8 + T cell subsets have been positioned along a pathway of differentiation, which is also considered as a process of lymphocyte aging or senescence. A similar categorization has not been clearly established for γδ and NK cell populations. Moreover, the distinction between the aging of these populations due to cellular differentiation or due to the chronological age of the donor has not been formally considered. In this study, we performed systematic measurements of telomere length and telomerase activity in human ab CD8 + , γδ, and NK lymphocytes based on subset division and across age to address these points and better understand the dichotomy between differentiation and temporal aging. This approach enables us to position phenotypically distinct γδ or NK subsets along a putative pathway of differentiation, such as for CD8 + T cells. Moreover, our data show that both cellular differentiation and donor aging have profound but independent effects on telomere length and telomerase activity of lymphocyte subpopulations, implying distinct mechanisms and consequences on the immune system. © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063272920

Chronic systemic inflammation is thought to be a hallmark of ageing, but the relationship between an increased epigenetic age and this likely key phenotype of ageing has not yet been extensively investigated. Methods: We modelled the trajectories of the inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP; measured using both a high- and low-sensitivity assay) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) over the eighth decade in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Using linear mixed models, we investigated the association between CRP and immune cell profiles imputed from the methylation data and examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between the inflammatory biomarkers and two measures of epigenetic age acceleration, derived from the Horvath and Hannum epigenetic clocks. Results: We found that low-sensitivity CRP declined, high-sensitivity CRP did not change, and IL-6 increased over time within the cohort. CRP levels inversely associated with CD8+T cells and CD4+T cells and positively associated with senescent CD8+T cells, plasmablasts and granulocytes. Cross-sectionally, the Hannum, but not the Horvath, measure of age acceleration was positively associated with each of the inflammatory biomarkers, including a restricted measure of CRP (≤ 10 mg/L) likely reflecting levels relevant to chronic inflammation. Conclusions: We found a divergent relationship between inflammation and immune system parameters in older age.

It must also include measurements that take into account suppressive effects on the earliest plant life stages of resident individuals - seeds, their germination (emergence of radicles and cotyledons), and very young rooted seedlings. In this study, we explored the potential for these effects in a field experiment spanning three years, using a novel design for controlling granivory and small mammal herbivory. This allowed us to assess the limitations of natural crowding on seed recruitment success for non-resident species introduced into both natural and denuded neighbourhood plots within a temperate mesic old field meadow in eastern Ontario, Canada. Our results show that crowding by standing vegetation of resident species caused an overall reduction of seed recruitment success by more than 90%. These data provide strong inference that suppression resulting directly from near neighbour effects are likely to impose routinely intense natural selection within temperate mesic old field habitats like our study site. The consequences of this selection, in terms of traits promoting plant fitness under competition, are traditionally interpreted in terms of superior resource depletion/uptake, typically associated with greater growth accumulation and larger potential body size. We suggest, however, that these consequences are rare. Individuals of any species approach maximum potential body size only when near neighbour effects are relatively weak - not within crowded neighbourhoods. Recent studies suggest that severe neighbourhood crowding (where virtually all resident plants are forced to remain relatively small) selects instead for 'reproductive economy' - i.e., capacity to produce at least a few (or even at least one) offspring despite severe body size suppression, involving a relatively small minimum reproductive threshold size. Potential for additional component traits of reproductive economy are also suggested for investigation in future research. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060711390

However, how they influence offspring resistance to herbivory remains largely unknown. In this study we experimentally examined the effects of ungulates and pre-dispersal seed predators on seed quality as well as on the emergence, survival and resistance to herbivory of the seedlings of a semiarid herb. We found that ungulates reduced seedling recruitment but increased seedling resistance to leaf miners. These effects were probably a consequence of insufficient carbon provisioning in seeds that reduced seed viability and provoked carbon limitation in seedlings. Pre-dispersal seed predators did not influence seedling recruitment, but seedlings from mothers damaged by ungulates and by pre-dispersal seed predators suffered less herbivory by grasshoppers. Remarkably, intra-individual differences in damage by pre-dispersal seed predators affected the rate of damage underwent by seedlings. That is, seedlings derived from fruits attacked by seed predators were more resistant to herbivores than siblings derived from un-attacked fruits in plant populations exposed to ungulates. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting variation in transgenerational-induced resistance of seedlings from the same maternal plant. This study is a valuable contribution to the understanding of transgenerational effects of multiple herbivores and their implications for a deeper comprehension of the natural systems in which they co-occur. © 2018 Aguirrebengoa et al.

In N. furzeri, the increase of maternal and paternal age is often a predictable indicator of the upcoming deterioration on their natural habitat (i.e., ephemeral puddles) during African dry season. We previously revealed that elderly parents respond to their physiological decline state by decelerating offspring's development and growth rate. In the present study, we focused on the effects of different age parents at the onset of female offspring's sexual maturity since interaction between growth and reproduction traits generally occurs in vertebrates and could represent a life strategy. For this purpose, four different age breeder groups were set up. The age-specific breeder differences in reproductive performance were examined by analyzing the reproductive age-related fitness, the gametogenesis process in F1 females by histology, the offspring oocytes quality analyzing the gene expression of age-related molecular markers, like sirt1 and foxo3a, and the biochemical composition of vitellogenic oocytes using a spectroscopic approach. Results suggest that both maternal and paternal age affect reproductive performance and could influence the onset of sexual maturity in female offspring. In conclusion, these findings highlighted the effects of parental aging on life history traits in the short-lived model N. furzeri. Our results suggested that the advanced sexual maturity in offspring from young parents could be related to an adaptive response to the temporary habitat conditions. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057542667

The most frequent gene mutations were DNMT3A (27%), TET2 (25%), IDH2 (23% [R140, 15%; R172, 8%]), and TP53 (21%). Compared with wild-type, OS was significantly reduced among CCR-treated patients with TP53 or NRAS mutations and azacitidine-treated patients with FLT3 or TET2 mutations. Azacitidine may be a preferred treatment for older patients with AML with Adverse-risk cytogenetics, particularly those with chromosome 5, 7, and/or 17 abnormalities and complex or monosomal karyotypes. The influence of gene mutations in azacitidine-treated patients warrants further study. © 2018, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054536821

Our study demonstrated that the upregulation of Trx in both the cytosol and mitochondria in male TXNTg × TXN2Tg C57BL/6 mice resulted in a significantly shorter lifespan compared to wild-type (WT) mice.

Furthermore, the total number of histopathological changes in the whole body (disease burden) was significantly higher in TXNTg × TXN2Tg mice compared to WT mice.

We therefore investigated the reproductive success of 65 captive devil pair combinations, of which 35 produced offspring (successful pairs) whereas the remaining 30 pairs, despite being observed mating, produced no offspring (unsuccessful pairs). The devils were screened at six MHC Class I-linked microsatellite loci. Our analyses revealed that younger females had a higher probability of being successful than older females. In the successful pairs we also observed a higher difference in total number of heterozygous loci, i.e. when one devil had a high total number of heterozygous loci, its partner had low numbers. Our results therefore suggest that devil reproductive success is subject to disruptive MHC selection, which to our knowledge has never been recorded in any vertebrate.

The aim of the following experiment was to estimate transgenerational epigenetic variance for egg quality traits using genealogical and phenotypic information in meat-type quail. Measured traits included egg length (EL) and width (EWD), albumen weight (AW), shell weight (SW), yolk weight (YW) and egg weight (EW). 2. A total of 391 birds were evaluated for egg quality by collecting a sample of one egg per bird, during three consecutive days, starting on the 14th d of production. Analyses were performed using mixed models including the random epigenetic effect. Variance components were estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood method. A grid-search for values for the auto-recursive parameter (λ) was used in the variance components estimation. This parameter is directly related to the reset (v) and epigenetic transmissibility (1 − v) coefficients. 3. The epigenetic effect was not significant for any of the egg quality traits evaluated. Direct heritability estimates for egg quality traits ranged in magnitude from 0.06 to 0.33, whereby the higher estimates were found for AW and SW. Epigenetic heritability estimates were low and close to zero (ranging from 0.00 to 0.07) for all evaluated traits. 4.

Furthermore, a clear technical bias has emerged in studies of mitochondrial effects on reproduction, with many studies conducted on males, but few on females. Here, we apply a classic prediction of the evolutionary theory of aging to the mitochondrial genome, predicting the declining force of natural selection with age will have facilitated the accumulation of mtDNA mutations that confer late-life effects on female reproductive performance. This should lead to increased levels of mitochondrial genetic variation on reproduction at later-life stages. We tested this hypothesis using thirteen strains of Drosophila melanogaster that each possessed a different mitochondrial haplotype in an otherwise standard nuclear genetic background. We measured fecundity and egg-to-adult viability of females over five different age classes ranging from early to late life and quantified the survival of females throughout this time period. We found no significant variation across mitochondrial haplotypes for the reproductive traits, and no mitochondrial effect on the slope of decline in these traits with increasing age. However, we observed that flies that died earlier in the experiment experienced steeper declines in the reproductive traits prior to death, and we also identified maternal and grandparental age effects on the measured traits. These results suggest the mitochondrial variation does not make a key contribution to shaping the reproductive performance of females. © 2018 The Authors.

Study design: We analyzed data from the Health, Well-Being and Aging study (SABE), a cohort that started in 2000. Mortality data up to September 2016 were obtained by linkage from the Program for Mortality Information of São Paulo (PRO-AIM). Main outcome measures: We used Cox regression to analyze all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and cancer, according to age at menopause, categorized as <40, 41–44, 45–49, 50–54 (reference) and ≥55. Results: After 16 years of follow-up, there were 444 deaths, of which 199 were from cardiovascular diseases, 73 from respiratory diseases and 65 from cancer. After adjustment for socioeconomic, reproductive and lifestyle factors, having an early menopause (at age 41–44) was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.48, 95% IC: 1.03, 2.14) relative to NM at 50–54 years. Women aged 41–44 and 45–49 at NM had twice the risk of cancer mortality of the reference group. We did not find significant associations between age at NM and cause-specific mortality for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that early menopause is associated with all-cause mortality in the largest city of Latin America. In addition, earlier age at NM was associated with cancer mortality. These results suggest that age at NM may be a biomarker for mortality, irrespective of country of residence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053211557

Generally, natural aquatic populations are characterized by a variety of multi-structured age groups, for which physiological and biochemical responses typically differ. The freshwater cladoceran, Daphnia pulex, is a model species used extensively in environmental monitoring studies and ecotoxicology testing. Here, the effects of a polystyrene nanoplastic on the physiological changes (i.e., survival) and expression levels of stress defense genes (i.e., those encoding antioxidant-mediated and heat shock proteins) in this freshwater flea were measured. Results from acute bioassays were used to determine the respective nanoplastic LC50 values for five age groups (1-, 4-, 7-, 14- and 21-day-old individuals): the obtained values for the 1- and 21-day-old D. pulex groups were similar (i.e., not significantly different). The expression levels of genes encoding key stress defense enzymes and proteins—SOD, CAT, GST, GPx, HSP70, and HSP90—were influenced by the nanoplastic in all the age groups, but not in the same way for each. Significant differences were observed among all age groups in their expression of the gene encoding the energy-sensing enzyme AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) α β and γ following exposure to the nanoplastic. Moreover, the expression of AMPK α was significantly increased in the 1-, 7-, and 21-day-old individuals exposed to nanoplastic relative to the control group. Together, these results indicate that age in D. pulex affects the sensitivity of its individuals to pollution from this nanoplastic, primarily via alterations to vital physiological and biochemical processes, such as cellular energy homeostasis and oxidation, which were demonstrated in vivo. We speculate that such age-related effects may extend to other nanoplastics and forms of pollution in D. pulex and perhaps similar marine organisms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052245557

Here, we aimed to characterize longitudinal age-related methylation patterns using 1011 blood samples collected from 385 Swedish twins (age at entry: mean 69 and standard deviation 9.7, 73 monozygotic and 96 dizygotic pairs) up to five times (mean 2.6) over 20 years (mean 8.7). We identified 1316 age-associated methylation sites (P&lt;1.3×10 −7 ) using a longitudinal epigenome-wide association study design. We measured how estimated cellular compositions changed with age and how much they confounded the age effect. We validated the results in two independent longitudinal cohorts, where 118 CpGs were replicated in Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS, 390 samples) (P&lt;3.9×10 −5 ), 594 in Lothian Birth Cohort (LBC, 3018 samples) (P&lt;5.1×10 −5 ) and 63 in both. Functional annotation of age-associated CpGs showed enrichment in CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and other transcription factor binding sites. We further investigated genetic influences on methylation and found no interaction between age and genetic effects in the 1316 age-associated CpGs. Moreover, in the same CpGs, methylation differences within twin pairs increased with 6.4% over 10 years, where monozygotic twins had smaller intra-pair differences than dizygotic twins. In conclusion, we show that age-related methylation changes persist in a longitudinal perspective, and are fairly stable across cohorts. The changes are under genetic influence, although this effect is independent of age. Moreover, methylation variability increase over time, especially in age-associated CpGs, indicating the increase of environmental contributions on DNA methylation with age. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Natural populations, however, show a substantial amount of variation in social behaviour that is uncorrelated with relatedness. Age offers a major alternative explanation for variation in behaviour that remains unaccounted for. Most natural populations are structured into age-classes, with ageing being a nearly universal feature of most major taxa, including eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Despite this, the theoretical underpinnings of age-dependent social behaviour remain limited. Here, I investigate how group age-composition, demography and life history shape trajectories of age-dependent behaviours that are expressed conditionally on an actor and recipient's age. I show that demography introduces novel age-dependent selective pressures acting on social phenotypes. Furthermore, I find that life history traits influence the costs and benefits of cooperation directly, but also indirectly. Life history has a strong impact not only on the genetic structure of the population but also on the distribution of group age-compositions, with both of these processes influencing the expression of age-dependent cooperation. Age of peak reproductive performance, in particular, is of chief importance for the evolution of cooperation, as this will largely determine the age and relatedness of social partners. Moreover, my results suggest that later-life reproductive senescence may occur because of demographic effects alone, which opens new vistas on the evolution of menopause and related phenomena. © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

The low education sample was selected from a representative survey at local neighborhood health centers, while the high education group consisted of a convenience sample recruited by advertising in community centers and centers affiliated with the local university. Relative leukocyte TL was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction from blood samples. ACEs were self-reported. Spline linear regression was fitted to assess the strength of the associations between ACEs and TL. Among women with low education, median TL was 1.02 compared with 0.64 in the high education group (p = 0.0001). Natural log-transformed T/S ratio as the dependent variable was used in analysis. Women with low education had been exposed to more ACEs, and among them those experiencing two or more ACEs had longer TL than women exposed to ≤1 ACEs (p = 0.03); among women with high education, this difference was not significant (p = 0.49). In analyses adjusted by age, education, and parental abuse of alcohol, the linear trend of higher TL with increasing ACEs was confirmed (p = 0.02), and the mean difference in TL between groups remained significant (p = 0.002). The unexpected positive relationship between low education and ACEs with TL suggests that older adults who have survived harsh conditions prevailing in Northeast Brazil have the longest TL of their birth cohort. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034788929

Participants were selected from the community population of individuals in a post-reproductive stage (N = 255; Mage = 64.9 years). Results from the regression analyses showed that the number of children was associated with lower scores on Honesty and Openness and higher scores on Emotionality; Agreeableness was positively associated with this criterion but only in males. The number of grandchildren was predicted by low Openness and marginally by high Conscientiousness, while Honesty had positive zero-order correlation with the criterion measure.

For long-lived, migratory species, the non-breeding period represents a critical time for investment in self-maintenance and restoration of body condition, which in many species is linked to fitness. However, the relationships between age, non-breeding foraging behaviour and fitness remain largely unexplored. We performed a cross-sectional study, investigating age-related variation in the foraging activity, distribution and diet of an extremely long-lived seabird, the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, during the non-breeding period. Eighty-two adults aged 8–33 years were tracked with geolocator-immersion loggers, and body feathers were sampled for stable isotope analysis. We tested for variation in metrics of foraging behaviour and linked age-related trends to subsequent reproductive performance. There was an age-related decline in the number of landings (a proxy of foraging effort) during daylight hours, and a decrease in body feather δ13C values in older males but not females, yet this did not accompany an age-related shift in distributions. Males conducted fewer landings than females, and the sexes showed some spatial segregation, with males foraging further south, likely due to their differential utilization of winds. Although younger (&lt;20 years) birds had higher foraging effort, they all went on to breed successfully the following season. In contrast, among older (20+ years) birds, individuals that landed more often were more likely to defer breeding or fail during incubation, suggesting they have lower foraging success. As far as we are aware, this is the first demonstration of an age-specific carry-over effect of foraging behaviour in the non-breeding period on subsequent reproductive performance. This link between foraging behaviour and fitness in late but not early adulthood indicates that the ability of individuals to forage efficiently outside the breeding period may be an important driver of fitness differences in old age.

Notwithstanding, marine organisms may maintain their performance under future OA conditions, either through acclimation or evolutionary adaptation. Surprisingly, the transgenerational effects of high CO2 exposure in crustaceans are still poorly understood. For the first time, the present study investigated the transgenerational effect of OA, from hatching to maturity, of a key amphipod species (Gammarus locusta). Negative transgenerational effects were observed on survival of the acidified lineage, resulting in significant declines (10-15%) compared to the control groups in each generation. Mate-guarding duration was also significantly reduced under high CO2 and this effect was not alleviated by transgenerational acclimation, indicating that precopulatory behaviours can be disturbed under a future high CO2 scenario. Although OA may initially stimulate female investment, transgenerational exposure led to a general decline in egg number and fecundity. Overall, the present findings suggest a potential fitness reduction of natural populations of G. locusta in a future high CO2 ocean, emphasizing the need of management tools towards species’ sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046168700

However, longitudinal data on changes in telomere length across the lifespan are difficult to obtain, particularly for long-lived animals. Quasi-longitudinal studies have been proposed as a method to gain insight into telomere dynamics in long-lived species. In this method, minimally replicative cells are used as the baseline telomere length against which telomere length in highly replicative cells (which represent the current state) can be compared. Here we test the assumptions and predictions of the quasi-longitudinal approach using longitudinal telomere data in a wild cooperative mammal, the banded mongoose, Mungos mungo. Contrary to our prediction, telomere length (TL) was longer in leukocytes than in ear cartilage. Longitudinally, the TL of ear cartilage shortened with age, but there was no change in the TL of leukocytes, and we also observed many individuals in which TL increased rather than decreased with age. Leukocyte TL but not cartilage TL was a predictor of total lifespan, while neither predicted post-sampling survival. Our data do not support the hypothesis that cross-tissue comparison in TL can act as a quasi-longitudinal marker of senescence. Rather, our results suggest that telomere dynamics in banded mongooses are more complex than is typically assumed, and that longitudinal studies across whole life spans are required to elucidate the link between telomere dynamics and senescence in natural populations. © 2018 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031311914

Short-term metrics for evaluating translocation success and its drivers, like postrelease survival and fecundity, are unlikely to represent longer-term outcomes. We used information theory to investigate 25 years of data on black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) translocations. We used the offspring recruitment rate (ORR) of translocated females—a metric integrating survival, fecundity, and offspring recruitment at sexual maturity—to detect determinants of success. Our unambiguously best model (AICω = 0.986) predicted that ORR increases with female age at release as a function of lower postrelease adult rhinoceros sex ratio (males:females). Delay of first postrelease reproduction and failure of some females to recruit any calves to sexual maturity most influenced the pattern of ORRs, and the leading causes of recruitment failure were postrelease female death (23% of all females) and failure to calve (24% of surviving females). We recommend translocating older females (≥6 years old) because they do not exhibit the reproductive delay and low ORRs of juveniles (<4 years old) or the higher rates of recruitment failure of juveniles and young adults (4–5.9 years old). Where translocation of juveniles is necessary, they should be released into female-biased populations, where they have higher ORRs. Our study offers the unique advantage of a long-term analysis across a large number of replicate populations—a science-by-management experiment as a proxy for a manipulative experiment, and a rare opportunity, particularly for a large, critically endangered taxon such as the black rhinoceros. Our findings differ from previous recommendations, reinforce the importance of long-term data sets and comprehensive metrics of translocation success, and suggest attention be shifted from ecological to social constraints on population growth and species recovery, particularly when translocating species with polygynous breeding systems. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047823930

We examined whether variation in the timing of the first seasonal clutch was related to age and telomere length in female dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), predicting that older females and those with shorter telomeres would breed earlier. Both predictions held true and were independent of each other, as telomere length did not significantly vary with age.

Delineating the impact of age-associated factors such as short telomeres is critical to enhance the regenerative potential of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). We hypothesized that short telomeres activate p53 and induce autophagy to elicit the age-associated change in CPC fate. We isolated CPCs and compared mouse strains with different telomere lengths for phenotypic characteristics of aging. Wild mouse strain Mus musculus castaneus (CAST) possessing short telomeres exhibits early cardiac aging with cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, fibrosis, and senescence, as compared with common lab strains FVB and C57 bearing longer telomeres. CAST CPCs with short telomeres demonstrate altered cell fate as characterized by cell cycle arrest, senescence, basal commitment, and loss of quiescence. Elongation of telomeres using a modified mRNA for telomerase restores youthful properties to CAST CPCs. Short telomeres induce autophagy in CPCs, a catabolic protein degradation process, as evidenced by reduced p62 and increased accumulation of autophagic puncta. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagosome formation reverses the cell fate to a more youthful phenotype. Mechanistically, cell fate changes induced by short telomeres are partially p53 dependent, as p53 inhibition rescues senescence and commitment observed in CAST CPCs, coincident with attenuation of autophagy. In conclusion, short telomeres activate p53 and autophagy to tip the equilibrium away from quiescence and proliferation toward differentiation and senescence, leading to exhaustion of CPCs. This study provides the mechanistic basis underlying age-associated cell fate changes that will enable identification of molecular strategies to prevent senescence of CPCs.

Our data reveal markedly different cell-type- and hematopoietic-lineage-specific chromatin modification patterns. Differential analysis between younger and older adults shows that aging is associated with increased heterogeneity between individuals and elevated cell-to-cell variability in chromatin modifications. Analysis of a twin cohort unveils heritability of chromatin modifications and demonstrates that aging-related chromatin alterations are predominantly driven by non-heritable influences. Together, we present a powerful platform for chromatin and immunology research. Our discoveries highlight the profound impacts of aging on chromatin modifications.

H3K27me3, a highly conserved histone modification signifying transcriptional repression, is marked and maintained by Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs). Here, we explore the mechanism by which age-modulated increase of H3K27me3 impacts adult lifespan. Using Drosophila, we reveal that aging leads to loss of fidelity in epigenetic marking and drift of H3K27me3 and consequential reduction in the expression of glycolytic genes with negative effects on energy production and redox state. We show that a reduction of H3K27me3 by PRCs-deficiency promotes glycolysis and healthy lifespan. While perturbing glycolysis diminishes the pro-lifespan benefits mediated by PRCs-deficiency, transgenic increase of glycolytic genes in wild-type animals extends longevity. Together, we propose that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 is one of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to aging and that stimulation of glycolysis promotes metabolic health and longevity. © Ma et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051945202

The host instar at the time of parasitoid egg ingestion significantly affected the development time of the immature parasitoid: development took longer when the hosts ingested eggs when at the fifth instar than at the sixth (last) instar. There was no difficulty obtaining mated females in the laboratory when day 0–1 female flies were kept with day 2–4 males. Mean lifetime fecundity was 5805 ± 568 eggs per female.

Therefore, the percentage adult emergence per egg ingested decreased from NEI 6 to 10, particularly in the case of last instars.

The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis suggests that differences in personalities result from divergent life-history strategies, with more active/risk-taking individuals reproducing rapidly but dying young. However, studies of wild animals provide only limited support for key elements of this and related hypotheses, such as a negative relationship between residual reproductive value and activity. Furthermore, alternative models make divergent predictions regarding the relationship between risk-taking behaviours and variables consistent in the short-term, such as condition. To test these predictions, we regularly measured willingness to leave a shelter and the activity level of wild adult field crickets (Gryllus campestris) at both short and long intervals over their entire adult lives. We found some support for a pace-of-life syndrome influencing personality, as lifespan was negatively related to willingness to leave the shelter and activity. Crickets did not appear to protect their “assets” however, as estimates of residual reproductive value were not related to behaviour. Although there was considerable variance attributed to the short-term consistency, neither trait was affected by phenotypic condition, failing to support either of the models we tested. Our study confirms that behaviours may covary with some life-history traits and highlights the scales of temporal consistency that are more difficult to explain. © 2018 The Authors.

When exposed to C.sp-P as adults, female An. gambiae suffered reduced longevity, but experienced no change in fecundity. The offspring of these females, however, had higher mortality as larvae and were slower to develop compared to offspring of control females. We also found that the mosquitocidal activity of C.sp-P was retained after removal of live cells from biofilm culture media, suggesting the bacteria secrete mosquitocidal compound(s) into the media during growth. Exposure to this cell-free C.sp-P-conditioned media caused female midgut transcriptional changes comprising detoxification, xenobiotic response, and stress response genes, suggesting the physiological response to C.sp-P is similar to that of insecticide exposure. Finally, we found that multiple members of the Chromobacterium genus had mosquitocidal activity, but this activity was highest in mosquitoes treated with C.sp-P. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that C.sp-P produces factor(s) with strong effects on mosquito longevity and fitness, which may be of interest for mosquitocide development. More generally, they indicate that further exploration of mosquito-associated and environmental microbes for novel insecticidal compounds or biocontrol agents is warranted. © 2018 The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044951780

Numerous studies have demonstrated inter- or multi-generational effects of changing environment in birds, but very few studies have been published showing epigenetic transgenerational inheritance in these species. In this review, we mention work conducted in parent-to-offspring transmission analyses in bird species, with a focus on the impact of early stressors on behaviour.

Such bias among adults may be critical to population growth and viability. Nevertheless, demographic mechanisms for biased adult sex ratios are still poorly understood. Here, we examined potential demographic mechanisms for the recent dramatic shift from a slight female bias among adult eider ducks (Somateria mollissima) to a male bias (about 65% males) in the Baltic Sea, where the species is currently declining. We analysed a nine-year dataset on offspring sex ratio at hatching based on molecularly sexed ducklings of individually known mothers. Moreover, using demographic data from long-term individual-based capture-recapture records, we investigated how sex-specific survival at different ages after fledgling can modify the adult sex ratio. More specifically, we constructed a stochastic two-sex matrix population model and simulated scenarios of different survival probabilities for males and females. We found that sex ratio at hatching was slightly female-biased (52.8%) and therefore unlikely to explain the observed male bias among adult birds. Our stochastic simulations with higher survival for males than for females revealed that despite a slight female bias at hatching, study populations shifted to a male-biased adult sex ratio (> 60% males) in a few decades. This shift was driven by prime reproductive-age individuals (5-year-old), with sex-specific survival of younger age classes playing a minor role. Hence, different age classes contributed disproportionally to population dynamics. We argue that an alternative explanation for the observed male dominance among adults–sex-biased dispersal–can be considered redundant and is unlikely, given the ecology of the species. The present study highlights the importance of considering population structure and age-specific vital rates when assessing population dynamics and management targets. © 2018 Ramula et al.

Methods: We present a quantitative analysis of transgenerational transmission of global DNA cytosine methylation (= proportion of all genomic cytosines that are methylated) and individual epigenetic markers (= methylation status of anonymous MSAP markers) in the shrub Lavandula latifolia. Methods based on parent-offspring correlations and parental variance component estimation were applied to epigenetic features of field-growing plants (‘maternal parents’) and greenhouse-grown progenies. Transmission of genetic markers (AFLP) was also assessed for reference. Key Results: Maternal parents differed significantly in global DNA cytosine methylation (range = 21.7–36.7%). Greenhouse-grown maternal families differed significantly in global methylation, and their differences were significantly related to maternal origin. Methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) markers exhibited significant transgenerational transmission, as denoted by significant maternal variance component of marker scores in greenhouse families and significant mother-offspring correlations of marker scores. Conclusions: Although transmission-related measurements for global methylation and MSAP markers were quantitatively lower than those for AFLP markers taken as reference, this study has revealed extensive transgenerational transmission of genome-wide global cytosine methylation and anonymous epigenetic markers in L. latifolia. Similarity of results for global cytosine methylation and epigenetic markers lends robustness to this conclusion, and stresses the value of considering both types of information in epigenetic studies of nonmodel plants. © 2018 Botanical Society of America",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044056058

So far, efforts to detect a latitudinal gradient in survival have found no statistical support, leading to the hypothesis that a gradient may be present in the survival of juveniles alone. Such a gradient could be masked by the data on adults when field records make no distinction between ages. We aimed to (1) assess the effect of age on survival of tropical birds by estimating age-specific annual apparent survival probabilities for a set of 40 passerine understory species from the central Brazilian Amazon and (2) test the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in adult survival with a meta-analysis of tropical and temperate-zone forest passerine survival probabilities at study areas from Peru to Alaska. We estimated age-specific survival using a hierarchical, multispecies Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model that treats species-specific parameters as random effects. To extend our analysis to data on birds of unknown age at the time of banding, we developed a novel CJS model with a mixture component for the survival of birds of unknown age. We found a strong effect of age on survival at our site, with juveniles having lower survival than adults. The meta-analysis of 342 survival estimates from 175 species and a latitude span of >60 degrees revealed a negative effect of latitude on survival, which supports the widely accepted hypothesis that, on average, tropical birds have higher annual survival than their temperate counterparts. We conclude that there is no need for an alternative latitudinal trend in juvenile survival to account for the general trend in clutch size. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043469075

In the Old World, birds often form conspecific foraging groups that are maintained year-round and offspring usually disperse to other social groups. We tested the hypothesis that nonbreeding group members are largely unrelated and gain direct fitness benefits through breeding opportunities (males) and brood parasitism (females) in the tropical gray-Throated babbler, Stachyris nigriceps, in Malaysian Borneo. Babblers foraged in social groups containing one or more breeding pairs (median = 8 group members of equal sex ratio), but group members rarely assisted with breeding (9% of 67 breeding pairs had a third helper; exhibiting facultative cooperative breeding). Although 20% of 266 group member dyads were first-order relatives of one or both members of the breeding pairs, 80% were unrelated. Male group members gained direct fitness benefits through extrapair and extra-group paternity (25% of 73 offspring), which was independent of their relatedness to the breeding pair and increased with decreasing group size. In contrast, females did not gain direct fitness benefits through brood parasitism. The low levels of relatedness and helping in social groups suggest that most group members do not gain indirect fitness benefits by helping to raise unrelated offspring. These findings highlight the importance of examining benefits of sociality for unrelated individuals that largely do not help and broaden the direct fitness benefits of group foraging beyond assumed survival benefits. © The Author(s) 2018.

Platin-5-fluorouracil (CF) combination chemotherapy is the most widely used protocol and addition of a taxane (TCF) seems to increase survival and toxicity rates. We aimed to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of TCF as compared to CF in patients older than 65 years and compare them with the patients younger than 65 years. Methods: A total of 341 patients with AGC have been treated at six different oncology centers in Turkey between 2010 and 2014 and evaluated retrospectively. The characteristics of the patients whose tumors were histologically confirmed and whose survival data were available were registered and analyzed. The study group consisted of 234 patients younger than 65 years (group 1) and 107 patients older than 65 years (group 2). All of the data obtained from the patients were statistically analyzed. Results: The median age of the patients was 58.2 years and the mean follow-up time 14.4 months. For the entire group, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 9 and 13 months, respectively. Using TCF over CF regimen increased the OS by 4.2 months (i.e., group 1 and 2 together). For group 2, patients with liver metastases and without surgery of the primary tumor were treated with significantly more TCF as compared to CF, respectively. Although TCF yielded significantly higher PFS and OS in group 1 (p=0.0001 and p=0.017), there was no significant difference in group 2 as compared to CF. Also, grade 3-4 toxicity was statistically defined as one of the possible reasons of worsened OS in patients older than 65 years and receiving TCF. Conclusions: The addition of taxanes to CF backbone leads to a significant increase in both PFS and OS in patients younger than 65 years of age but the triplet regimen with taxanes does not provide superior survival in patients older than 65 years of age. © 2017 Zerbinis Publications.

Very few reports on disease duration are currently available and predictors of survival are still undefined. The aim of the present study was to assess the natural history of FTD and to define predictors of survival. Methods: Four hundred amd eleven FTD patients, including 294 with behavioural variant FTD, 77 with agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and 40 with semantic variant PPA, were consecutively enrolled and demographic and clinical variables carefully recorded. Each patient underwent genetic screening for monogenic disease. Results: The mean survival time from onset of the symptoms was 7.8 ± 4.0 years. The presence of a pathogenic mutation (GRN, C9orf72 or MAPT) (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.85, 95% CI 1.04–3.31, p = 0.037) and older age at disease onset (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.07, p = 0.002) were associated with shorter life expectancy. However, a significant negative interaction between age at onset and genetic mutation was found, suggesting that the effect of age is different in patients with and without a genetic mutation (p = 0.028). Gender, clinical phenotype or education and occupation were not associated with survival risk. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that monogenic disease and age at onset are independent predictors of survival and should be considered in future clinical intervention trials and in patients’ and caregivers’ counselling. © 2017 World Federation of Neurology on behalf of the Research Group on Motor Neuron Diseases.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030831801

However, little is known about the capability of the immune cells of elderly individuals to dynamically counteract the oxidative stress. Here, the response of the main lymphocyte subsets to the induced oxidative stress in semisupercentenarians (CENT), their offspring (OFF), elderly controls (CTRL), and young individuals (YO) was analyzed using flow cytometry. The results showed that the ratio of the ROS levels between the induced and noninduced (I/NI) oxidative stress conditions was higher in CTRL and OFF than in CENT and YO, in almost all T, B, and NK subsets. Moreover, the ratio of reduced glutathione levels between I/NI conditions was higher in OFF and CENT compared to the other groups in almost all the subsets.

Telomerase functions to add telomeric repeats back onto the ends of chromosomes, however non-canonical roles of components of telomerase have recently been suggested. Methods: Here we use a zebrafish telomerase mutant which harbours a nonsense mutation in tert to investigate the adult phenotypes of fish derived from heterozygous parents of different ages. Furthermore we use whole genome sequencing data to estimate average telomere lengths. Results: We show that homozygous offspring from older heterozygotes exhibit signs of body wasting at a younger age than those of younger parents, and that offspring of older heterozygous parents weigh less irrespective of genotype. We also demonstrate that tert homozygous mutant fish have a male sex bias, and that clutches from older parents also have a male sex bias in the heterozygous and wild-type populations. Telomere length analysis reveals that the telomeres of younger heterozygous parents are shorter than those of older heterozygous parents. Conclusions: These data indicate that the phenotypes observed in offspring from older parents cannot be explained by telomere length. Instead we propose that Tert functions outside of telomere length maintenance in an age-dependent manner to influence the adult phenotypes of the next generation. © 2018 Scahill CM et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045506148

We investigated the impact of a delayed first natural pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes in the mouse model. Spatial learning capacity in young adult mouse offspring was observed by step-down passive avoidance task and Morris water maze (MWM). Maternal serum α-klotho was measured by ELISA. Morphological characteristics of fetoplacental unit and offspring brain were identified by H&E and immunohistochemistry. Klotho, VDR and other related genes expression were quantified by real-time-RT-PCR and western blot. We found delayed pregnancy reduced fertility in female mice by three-fold (Young vs. Old: 5.0% vs. 20.7%), and increased adverse pregnant outcomes by eight-fold (Young vs. Old: 3.0% vs. 27.5%). Mice born to old mothers exhibited shorter retention trial latency in passive avoidance task and longer latency to find the platform in MWM, suggesting worse performance on the tests that measure learning and memory. Serum α-klotho level was lower in old female mice before pregnancy, whereas became comparable after pregnancy. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression, both in mRNA and protein, markedly decreased during the early stage of fetoplacental unit in old mice, especially in trophoblast giant cells when compared with that of young mice. Importantly, consistent with fetoplacental unit, VDR expression also declined in hippocampus from offspring born to old mice. These results suggest that young adult offspring from aged mothers exhibited worse cognitive function and the reduced VDR expression during fetoplacental development might play an important role. © 2018, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

In the “longevity village” of Bama, China, we have identified two plant foods, hemp seed and bitter vegetable (Sonchus oleraceus), that are commonly consumed by its residents and grow abundantly in unfarmed land without fertilizers or pesticides. Here, we show that a diet composed of these two foods (the “HB diet”) provides a sufficient variety of nutrients and confers significant health benefits. Aged mice allowed ad libitum access to the HB diet not only had longer life spans and improved cognitive function but were also protected against age-related metabolic syndrome, fatty liver, gut dysbiosis and chronic inflammation compared to aged mice fed a control Western diet. Furthermore, longevity-related genes (including 5′adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, sirtuin 1, nuclear respiratory factor 1 and forkhead box O3) were significantly up-regulated, while aging-related genes (including mammalian target of rapamycin and nuclear factor kappa B) were down-regulated.

Summary Answer: Our study demonstrates that ovarian hyperstimulation and the in vitro procedure are not associated with BP values in 9-year-old children born to subfertile couples. What is Known Already: Possible long-term effects of IVF on child health and development have been studied relatively little. This is surprising, as it is known that environmental conditions may influence embryonic and foetal development which may result in health related problems in later life. Some studies suggested that IVF is associated with higher BP at pre-school age. Yet, it is unclear whether this may be also true for older children and if so, which component of IVF, i.e. the ovarian hyperstimulation, the embryo culture or a combination of these, attributes to this potentially less favourable BP. Study Design, Size, Duration: The Groningen Assisted Reproductive Technology cohort-study is a prospective assessor-blinded study of children followed from before birth onwards. In total, 170 children were assessed at the age of 9 years. The attrition rate up until the 9-year-old assessment was 21%. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods: We evaluated cardiovascular health, focusing on BP (in mmHg and the internationally recognized percentiles of the US National High BP Education Program), heart rate and anthropometrics of 57 children born following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation-IVF/ICSI (COH-IVF/ICSI); 47 children born after modified natural cycle-IVF/ICSI (MNC-IVF/ICSI); and 66 children who were conceived naturally by subfertile couples (Sub-NC). Cardiovascular parameters were measured multiple times on one day. In addition, anthropometric data, including BMI and skinfold thickness, were collected. Main Results and the Role of Chance: Systolic BP in mmHg did not differ between the COH-IVF/ICSI (mean 106.9, SD 6.7), MNC-IVF/ICSI (mean 104.8, SD 5.9) and Sub-NC (mean 106.3, SD 5.3) groups. In addition, systolic BP percentiles did not differ between the groups: COH-IVF/ICSI (mean 62.4, SD 20.2); MNC-IVF/ICSI (mean 56.3, SD 19.3); and Sub-NC (mean 62.3, SD17.8). Also, after adjustment for confounders BP in the three groups was similar. Heart rate and anthropometric values in the three groups did not differ. For instance, BMI values in the COH-IVF/ICSI-children were 16.3 (median value, range 13.0-24.7), in MNC-IVF/ICSI-children 16.1 (range 12.7-22.5) and in Sub-NC children 16.3 (range 12.7-24.0). Limitations, Reasons for Caution: The size of our study groups does not allow for pertinent conclusions on the effect of ovarian hyperstimulation and the in vitro procedure. The lack of a fertile control group may be regarded as another limitation. Wider Implications of the Findings: Our study suggests that ovarian hyperstimulation and in vitro procedures are not associated with cardiovascular health in 9-year-old. Yet, BP percentiles of the three groups were higher than the expected 50th percentile. This might indicate that children of subfertile couples have a higher BP than naturally conceived children.

The aim of this study was to test if African winter habitat is related to subsequent reproductive success of house martins (Delichon urbicum) breeding at a colony in Spain. We measured stable isotope (δ2H, δ13C, δ15N) values from feathers moulted in West Africa and used confirmatory path analysis to test if isotopic values of winter-grown feathers were related to reproductive success through the mediation of breeding phenology and body condition. We conducted separate analyses for males, females and age classes (yearlings vs ≥ 2 years old). Experienced males wintering in habitats of higher rainfall (as inferred from lower feather δ2H values) were in better body condition and produced more offspring during the subsequent breeding season. In contrast, we did not find any effect of winter habitat on reproductive success of young males or females. These findings provide evidence consistent with a complex causal link between winter habitat quality and subsequent breeding success of long-distance migratory songbirds. © 2017 The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039167532

For the biology of aging, it is very important not only to determine average mortality, but also to study its stability in time and the size of fluctuations that are indicated by the variation coefficient of lifespan (CVLS). It is believed that a relatively small (∼20%) value of CVLS in humans, comparable to the coefficients of variation of other events programmed in ontogenesis (for example, menarche and menopause), indicates a relatively rigid determinism (N. S. Gavrilova et al. (2012) Biochemistry (Moscow), 77, 754-760). To assess the prevalence of this phenomenon, we studied the magnitude of CVLS, as well as the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis in diverse representatives of the animal kingdom using data provided by the Institute for Demographic Research (O. R. Jones et al. (2014) Nature, 505, 169-173). We found that, unlike humans and laboratory animals, in most examined species the values of CVLS are rather high, indicating heterogeneity of the lifespan in the cohorts studied. This is probably due to the large influence of background mortality, as well as the non-monotonicity of total mortality in the wild, especially at the earliest ages. One way to account for this influence is to “truncate” the data (removing the earliest and latest ages from consideration). To reveal the effect of this procedure, we proposed a new indicator, the stability coefficient of mortality dynamics, which indicates how quickly CVLS is reduced to values that characterize a relatively homogeneous population (33%) when the data are “truncated”. Such indicators facilitate the use of the parameters of survival curves for analysis of the effects of geroprotectors, lifestyle, and other factors on lifespan, and for the quantification of relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the dynamics of aging in human and animal populations, including those living in the wild. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038429930

A reduction in its expression, which frequently occurs in mammalian cancer cells, extends lifespan and induces an adaptive response in C. elegans. However, these effects do not involve an increase in oxidative stress resistance. Here, we showed that intermittent exposure to hyperoxia, which induces oxidative stress resistance and lowers the production of ROS derived from mitochondrial respiration in C. elegans, slightly improved the lifespan extension of cep-1 mutant. Interestingly, ATP levels were increased without an increase in oxygen consumption in cep-1 mutant during aging. In the wild-type, lactate levels and consequentially the lactate/pyruvate ratio decreased during aging in adults. Furthermore, the expression levels of mitochondrial respiration-related sco-1, which is a target of p53/CEP-1, as well as those of gluconeogenesis regulation and mammalian sirtuin ortholog genes, were also increased in the aged and adaptive conditioned wild-type animals. In contrast, the lactate/pyruvate ratio increased in cells of the cep-1 mutant and was amplified by intermittent hyperoxia. These results suggest that impaired p53/CEP-1 leads to an imbalance in the age-related energy metabolic alteration between mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis and plays an important role in the extension of both intact and adaptive lifespans. © 2017 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033220408

We use qPCR to measure relative telomere length in 389 blood samples (n = 318 individuals) collected from an unmanaged population of sheep on St Kilda, where individual age and parentage are known.

This pathway is required for mitochondrial fusion in response to physical exertion, and for the associated extension in lifespan. We show that diverse longevity pathways exhibit increased levels of elongated mitochondria. The increased mitochondrial fusion is essential for longevity in the diverse longevity pathways, as inhibiting mitochondrial fusion reduces their lifespans to wild-type levels.

While aging has historically been thought to entail cell-autonomous, even stochastic changes, recent evidence suggests that modulation of this process can be hierarchal, wherein manipulations of nutrient-sensing neurons (e.g., in the hypothalamus) produce peripheral effects that may modulate the aging process itself. The most robust intervention extending lifespan, plausibly impinging on the aging process, involves different modalities of dietary restriction (DR). Lifespan extension by DR is associated with broad protection against diseases (natural and engineered).

Bats are the second largest mammalian Order and important providers of ecosystem services including insect pest control, pollination and seed dispersal. Yet, the lack of basic information on their demographic rates hampers detecting changes in population trends, and thus conservation efforts. 2. The elusive life-styles, that leads to imperfect and biased detection, limits the quantity of individually based information as well as the extent to which information can be utilised to assess accurate and unbiased demographic rates. 3. We overcome the problem of imperfect and biased detection using a multilevel capture-mark-recapture framework to produce robust estimates of survival during hibernation period, and to evaluate the effect of age, sex, social group, and external weather factors on survival and capture heterogeneity in three vespertilionid species (Myotis daubentonii, M. nattereri, and Plecotus auritus) from the same woodland community. 4.

We advocate careful attention to possible sources of biases when studying survival rates in the wild, considering species-specific life-history and population-specific features.

In Denmark, they occur most abundantly at organic farms, where they cannot be controlled by means of insecticides. On traditional farms, where chemical control is widely used, development of resistance is of increasing concern. Therefore, interest in biological control or other alternative methods has been growing during the recent years. In order to understand the complex relationships between a pest and its natural enemies in a variable environment, it is necessary to know how temperature affects the dynamics of the involved species. In this paper, we apply data derived from several existing sources to investigate the influence of temperature on development and survival of eggs, larvae, pupae, and adult stable flies, as well as on the fecundity of adult females. We demonstrate that the same modeling framework (called SANDY), previously applied to lifetable data of the pteromalid pupal parasitoid (Spalangia cameroni Perkins), a biological control agent used against stable flies, can also be used to model S. calcitrans. However, the predicted temperature responses depend on the data sources used to parameterize the model, which is reflected by differences in estimated population growth rates obtained from American and non-American studies. Elasticity analysis shows that growth rates are more sensitive to changes in viability, in particular of adult flies, than in fecundity, which may have implications for the management of stable fly populations. © The Authors 2017.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032666578

We found that, as predicted, TL was shorter in the population experiencing poor environmental conditions but that this difference was only significant in older individuals and was independent of sex and body mass. Unexpectedly, the difference was underpinned by a significant increase in TL with age in the population experiencing good environmental conditions, while there was no detectable relationship with age in poor conditions. These results demonstrate both the environmental sensitivity and complexity of telomere dynamics in natural mammal populations, and highlight the importance of longitudinal data to disentangle the within- and among-individual processes that generate them. © 2017 The Authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030485585

Such a relationship might be explained by variation in TL at conception (gamete effect) and/or by alteration of early growth conditions in species providing parental care. In a long-lived bird with bi-parental care, the Alpine swift (Apus melba), we exchanged an uneven number of 2 to 4-day-old nestlings between pairs as part of a brood size manipulation. Nestling TL was measured at 50 days after hatching, which allowed investigation of the influence of the age of both their biological and foster parents on offspring TL, after controlling for the manipulation. Nestling TL was negatively related to the age of their biological father and foster mother. Nestling TL did not differ between enlarged and reduced broods. These findings suggest that offspring from older males were fertilized by gametes with shorter telomeres, presumably due to a greater cell division history or a longer accumulation of damage, and that older females may have provided poorer parental care to their offspring. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Measuring nest defence intensity in 255 known-age blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii) of 19 age classes confirmed the inverted-U pattern: intensity of nest defence increased in young males and females until roughly 11–12 years and declined progressively afterwards. We discuss the processes that may generate this distinctive pattern. Regardless of the underlying processes, this study establishes the existence of age-related variation in parental care in a long-lived species. Natural variation in natal conditions has recently been shown to have long-term impacts on development, so this study raises the question whether age-related changes in parental care generate systematic variation in offspring phenotypes. Significance statement: In theory, age-related change in parental care can result in differences among offspring produced at different ages. However, parental behaviour has never been measured over the whole age-span of any long-lived species because of the difficulty of sampling very old animals in the field. We measured intensity of nest defence over the age-span and confirmed that blue-footed boobies exhibit an age-related quadratic pattern in this parental behaviour: defence intensity increases in early life and declines progressively afterwards. Our results imply that similar-shaped patterns may exist in other components of parental care, such as feeding and social interaction, potentially affecting the long-term development of offspring. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027566128

Fossil evidence for “Cope's Rule” in odonates is weak or nonexistent since the last major extinction event 65 million years ago, yet selection studies show consistent positive selection for increased body size among adults. In particular, we find that large males in natural populations of the banded demoiselle (Calopteryx splendens) over several generations have consistent fitness benefits both in terms of survival and mating success. Additionally, there was no evidence for stabilizing or conflicting selection between fitness components within the adult life-stage. This lack of stabilizing selection during the adult life-stage was independently supported by a literature survey on different male and female fitness components from several odonate species. We did detect several significant body size shifts among extant taxa using comparative methods and a large new molecular phylogeny for odonates. We suggest that the lack of Cope's rule in odonates results from conflicting selection between fitness advantages of large adult size and costs of long larval development.

On the basis of the considerable variation that exists between and within species, and even within populations, we may be able to infer the (age- and sex-specific) ecological trade-offs and constraints moulding migration systems from assessments of fitness associated with migration and wintering in different areas. During three consecutive breeding seasons, we compared the reproductive performance (timing of breeding, breeding success, chick body condition and post-fledging survival) of Eurasian spoonbills Platalea leucorodia that breed at a single breeding site in The Netherlands, but migrate different distances (c. 4,500 vs. 2,000 km, either or not crossing the Sahara) to and from wintering areas in southern Europe and West Africa. Using mark–recapture analysis, we further investigated whether survival until adulthood (recruitment probability) of chicks hatched between 2006 and 2010 was related to their hatch date and body condition. Long-distance migrants bred later, particularly the males, and raised chicks of poorer body condition than short-distance migrants. Hatch dates strongly advanced with increasing age in short-distance migrants, but hardly advanced in long-distance migrants, causing the difference in timing of breeding between long- and short-distance migrants to be more pronounced among older birds. Breeding success and chick body condition decreased over the season, and chicks that fledged late in the season or in poor condition were less likely to survive until adulthood. As a result, long-distance migrants—particularly the males and older birds—likely recruit fewer offspring into the breeding population than short-distance migrants. This inference is important for predicting the population-level consequences of changes in winter habitat suitability throughout the wintering range. Assuming that the long-distance migrants—being the birds that occupy the traditional wintering areas—are not the poorer quality birds, and that the observed age-dependent patterns in timing of breeding are driven by within-individual effects and not by selective disappearance, our results suggest that the strategy of long-distance migration, involving the crossing of the Sahara to winter in West Africa, incurred a cost by reducing reproductive output, albeit a cost paid only later in life. © 2017 The Authors.

Particularly, renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a final common pathway in most forms of progressive renal disease. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-associated protein (ATRAP), which was originally identified as a molecule that binds to AT1R, is highly expressed in the kidney. Previously, we have shown that ATRAP suppresses hyperactivation of AT1R signaling, but does not affect physiological AT1R signaling. Methods and Results--We hypothesized that ATRAP has a novel functional role in the physiological age-degenerative process, independent of modulation of AT1R signaling. ATRAP-knockout mice were used to study the functional involvement of ATRAP in the aging. ATRAP-knockout mice exhibit a normal age-associated appearance without any evident alterations in physiological parameters, including blood pressure and cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes. However, in ATRAP-knockout mice compared with wild-type mice, the following takes place: (1) age-associated renal function decline and tubulointerstitial fibrosis are more enhanced; (2) renal tubular mitochondrial abnormalities and subsequent increases in the production of reactive oxygen species are more advanced; and (3) life span is 18.4% shorter (median life span, 100.4 versus 123.1 weeks). As a key mechanism, age-related pathological changes in the kidney of ATRAP-knockout mice correlated with decreased expression of the prosurvival gene, Sirtuin1. On the other hand, chronic angiotensin II infusion did not affect renal sirtuin1 expression in wild-type mice. Conclusions--These results indicate that ATRAP plays an important role in inhibiting kidney aging, possibly through sirtuin1-mediated mechanism independent of blocking AT1R signaling, and further protecting normal life span. © 2017 The Authors and Medtronic.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030715533

Here, we will review recent experimental evidence showing that pluripotency gene-based cell reprogramming can erase the epigenetic marks of aging and rejuvenate cells from old individuals reversing most signs of aging and that when induced pluripotent stem cells are differentiated back to the cell type of origin, the rejuvenated cells share many of the features of wild-Type counterparts from young donors. This evidence supports the idea that progressive epigenetic dysregulation may be the key driver of organismal aging and challenges the conventional view of aging as an irreversible process.

A number of autophagy regulators have been identified. Here we demonstrated that mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), an enzyme with the most common single point mutation in humans, governs cardiac aging through regulation of autophagy. Myocardial mechanical and autophagy properties were examined in young (4 months) and old (26–28 months) wild-type (WT) and global ALDH2 transgenic mice. ALDH2 overexpression shortened lifespan by 7.7% without affecting aging-associated changes in plasma metabolic profiles. Myocardial function was compromised with aging associated with cardiac hypertrophy, the effects were accentuated by ALDH2. Aging overtly suppressed autophagy and compromised autophagy flux, the effects were exacerbated by ALDH2. Aging dampened phosphorylation of JNK, Bcl-2, IKKβ, AMPK and TSC2 while promoting phosphorylation of mTOR, the effects of which were exaggerated by ALDH2. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed increased dissociation between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 (result of decreased Bcl-2 phosphorylation) in aging, the effect of which was exacerbated with ALDH2. Chronic treatment of the autophagy inducer rapamycin alleviated aging-induced cardiac dysfunction in both WT and ALDH2 mice. Moreover, activation of JNK and inhibition of either Bcl-2 or IKKβ overtly attenuated ALDH2 activation-induced accentuation of cardiomyocyte aging. Examination of the otherwise elderly individuals revealed a positive correlation between cardiac function/geometry and ALDH2 gene mutation. Taken together, our data revealed that ALDH2 enzyme may suppress myocardial autophagy possibly through a complex JNK-Bcl-2 and IKKβ-AMPK-dependent mechanism en route to accentuation of myocardial remodeling and contractile dysfunction in aging.

Methods and Materials The data of patients with GBM who had underwent IMRT from May 2007 to December 2015 were entered into a prospective database. Analysis was performed on the data from patients diagnosed during or after 75 years of age. The primary endpoint was the median survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with respect to survival for patients aged 74 to 80 versus >80 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 3, extent of resection, a high radiation dose (60 Gy) versus any hypofractionated schedule, MGMT methylation status, planning target volume, and the use of temozolomide (TMZ) versus no TMZ. Results Of the 108 patients, 35 received best supportive care, 1 received TMZ alone, 40 received RT alone, and 32 received combined RT and TMZ. IMRT was delivered with a hypofractionated technique (40 Gy) in 58 patients or long-course RT (60 Gy) in 11 patients. The median age was 79 years, with 61.6% of patients aged 74 to 80 years and 38.4% aged >80 years. Of the 108 patients, 64 died during the follow-up period, with a median survival of 10 months (95% confidence interval 7.1-11.9), projected 12-month survival rate of 35.6%, and 24-month survival rate of 7.9%. On univariate analysis, the independent predictors of survival included younger age (P=.02), better performance status (P=.014), greater resection extent (P=.002), and TMZ use (P<.001). MGMT methylation status, RT dose, and planning target volume showed no significant differences between the groups. Only chemotherapy use remained statistically significant (P=.035) on multivariate analysis. Conclusion The current data underrepresent elderly patients aged >75 years with GBM. Despite elderly patients having a worse prognosis, the results of the present study suggest the presence of survival benefits with IMRT for selected patients that can be further extended with addition of TMZ.

We compared Ins2+/− mice to Ins2+/+ littermate controls, on a genetically stable Ins1 null background. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of livers from 25-week-old mice suggested potential for healthier aging and altered insulin sensitivity in Ins2+/− mice. Halving Ins2 lowered circulating insulin by 25%–34% in aged female mice, without altering Igf1 or circulating Igf1. Remarkably, decreased insulin led to lower fasting glucose and improved insulin sensitivity in aged mice.

We investigated how foraging behaviour during chick rearing varies in males and females with brood size, offspring age and individual body mass of parents, in a sexually size-dimorphic waterbird, the Whiskered Tern Chlidonias hybrida. Our study took place at the carp fish ponds in southern Poland, where both invertebrates (dragonflies, a typical prey of females - caught by picking) and small vertebrates (fish, tadpoles, frogs, males typical prey - caught by plunge-diving) are plentiful and available for both sexes during chick-rearing period. In total, 1680 attacks of 29 uniquely marked birds (16 males and 13 females) were observed during chick-rearing period. Foraging techniques were affected by sex of the parent and offspring age, interacting with body mass, and brood size. Males foraged mainly by plunge diving, but avoided this foraging technique if their broods were small and when offspring were young, probably because the chicks were too small to consume vertebrate prey caught by diving. In contrast, females foraged mostly by picking prey from the air, water surface or floating leaves, for most of chick-rearing period, but increased frequency of plunge diving as offspring age increased. A significant interaction between body mass and offspring age suggests that birds differing in body mass foraged differently as their offspring grew. We conclude that despite sex-specific differences in foraging behaviour (and prey type delivered to the chicks), both sexes in the Whiskered Tern alter foraging behaviour in response to both brood and individual birds' attributes.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026798222

For many organisms, individuals shift habitat choice as they age because optimal habitats vary across life stages. Despite age-specific habitat use in a variety of taxa, identification of the causal factors driving such variation is limited by a lack of experimental studies. Field observations of the brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei, show that juveniles use low, narrow perches whereas adults use relatively higher and thicker perches. We hypothesized that this variation is driven by interactions between age classes, rather than age-specific preference for microhabitat. We manipulated adult and juvenile densities in field enclosures with artificial trees to examine how inter-age class competition influences microhabitat choice. We predicted that juveniles would move to less desired microhabitats as adult density increased (i.e. individual behavioural response) and/or adults would negatively affect juvenile survival (via competition or cannibalism) in ways that would contribute to age-specific habitat use (i.e. natural selection). We found that adult males, but not females, reduced juvenile survival. However, neither adult male nor female density influenced juvenile microhabitat choice (i.e. perch height, width or substrate) via individual behavioural response or natural selection. We also tested whether juveniles influence adult microhabitat choice. As predicted, adults did not vary in microhabitat choice in response to juvenile presence.

Here, we investigate consequences of parental age for offspring fitness and test for age-assortative mating in a short-lived bird, the house wren (Troglodytes aedon). Offspring immunoresponsiveness increased with maternal age and decreased with paternal age, but the strength of these effects varied with the age of one's mate. Offspring immunoresponsiveness was augmented most with older mothers and younger fathers. Thus, we expected this combination of ages to yield the highest offspring fitness. However, offspring recruitment, longevity, and lifetime reproductive success were greatest when both parents were of above-average age. Consistent with the interactive effects of parental age on offspring fitness, we detected positive age-assortative mating among breeding pairs.

Global inequalities in access to health care are reflected in differences in cancer survival. The CONCORD programme was designed to assess worldwide differences and trends in population-based cancer survival. In this population-based study, we aimed to estimate survival inequalities globally for several subtypes of childhood leukaemia. Methods Cancer registries participating in CONCORD were asked to submit tumour registrations for all children aged 0–14 years who were diagnosed with leukaemia between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2009, and followed up until Dec 31, 2009. Haematological malignancies were defined by morphology codes in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third revision. We excluded data from registries from which the data were judged to be less reliable, or included only lymphomas, and data from countries in which data for fewer than ten children were available for analysis. We also excluded records because of a missing date of birth, diagnosis, or last known vital status. We estimated 5-year net survival (ie, the probability of surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis, after controlling for deaths from other causes [background mortality]) for children by calendar period of diagnosis (1995–99, 2000–04, and 2005–09), sex, and age at diagnosis (<1, 1–4, 5–9, and 10–14 years, inclusive) using appropriate life tables. We estimated age-standardised net survival for international comparison of survival trends for precursor-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Findings We analysed data from 89 828 children from 198 registries in 53 countries. During 1995–99, 5-year age-standardised net survival for all lymphoid leukaemias combined ranged from 10·6% (95% CI 3·1–18·2) in the Chinese registries to 86·8% (81·6–92·0) in Austria. International differences in 5-year survival for childhood leukaemia were still large as recently as 2005–09, when age-standardised survival for lymphoid leukaemias ranged from 52·4% (95% CI 42·8–61·9) in Cali, Colombia, to 91·6% (89·5–93·6) in the German registries, and for AML ranged from 33·3% (18·9–47·7) in Bulgaria to 78·2% (72·0–84·3) in German registries. Survival from precursor-cell ALL was very close to that of all lymphoid leukaemias combined, with similar variation. In most countries, survival from AML improved more than survival from ALL between 2000–04 and 2005–09. Survival for each type of leukaemia varied markedly with age: survival was highest for children aged 1–4 and 5–9 years, and lowest for infants (younger than 1 year). There was no systematic difference in survival between boys and girls. Interpretation Global inequalities in survival from childhood leukaemia have narrowed with time but remain very wide for both ALL and AML. These results provide useful information for health policy makers on the effectiveness of health-care systems and for cancer policy makers to reduce inequalities in childhood cancer survival.

We aimed to assess changes in mortality, disability in activities of daily living, and physical and cognitive functioning among oldest-old individuals between 1998 and 2008. Methods We used data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study. Three pairs of cohorts aged 80–89 years, 90–99 years, and 100–105 years (in total, 19 528 oldest-old participants) were examined; the two cohorts in each pair were born 10 years apart, with the same age at the time of the assessment in the 1998 and 2008 surveys. Four health outcomes were investigated: annual death rate, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), physical performance in three tests and cognitive function measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We used different tests and multivariate regression analyses to examine the cohort differences. Findings Controlling for various confounding factors, we noted that annual mortality among oldest-old individuals was substantially reduced between 0·2% and 1·3% in 1998–2008 compared with individuals of the same age born 10 years previously, and that disability according to activities of daily living had significantly reduced annually between 0·8% and 2·8%. However, cognitive impairment in the later cohorts increased annually between 0·7% and 2·2% and objective physical performance capacity (standing up from a chair, picking up a book from the floor, and turning around 360°) decreased anually between 0·4% and 3·8%. We also noted that female mortality was substantially lower than male mortality among the oldest-old, but that women's functional capacities in activities of daily living, cognition, and physical performance were worse than their male counterparts. Interpretation Advances in medications, lifestyle, and socioeconomics might compress activities of daily living disability, that is, benefits of success, but lifespan extension might expand disability of physical and cognitive functioning as more frail, elderly individuals survive with health problems, that is, costs of success.

Recently, DNA methylation-based marker of ageing, known as ‘epigenetic clock’, has been linked with cancer risk factors. This study aimed to evaluate whether the epigenetic clock is associated with breast cancer risk susceptibility and to identify potential epigenetics-based biomarkers for risk stratification. Methods Here, we profiled DNA methylation changes in a nested case–control study embedded in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (n = 960) using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip arrays and used the Horvath age estimation method to calculate epigenetic age for these samples. Intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA) was estimated as the residuals by regressing epigenetic age on chronological age. Results We observed an association between IEAA and breast cancer risk (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.007–1.076, P = 0.016). One unit increase in IEAA was associated with a 4% increased odds of developing breast cancer (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.007–1.076). Stratified analysis based on menopausal status revealed that IEAA was associated with development of postmenopausal breast cancers (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.020–1.11, P = 0.003). In addition, methylome-wide analyses revealed that a higher mean DNA methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands was associated with increased risk of breast cancer development (OR per 1 SD = 1.20; 95 %CI: 1.03–1.40, P = 0.02) whereas mean methylation levels at non-island CpGs were indistinguishable between cancer cases and controls. Conclusion Epigenetic age acceleration and CpG island methylation have a weak, but statistically significant, association with breast cancer susceptibility. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014082011

Despite a growing body of literature revealing jujube fruit’s health promoting properties such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammation and anti-oxidant effects (shown with cell-based in vitro platforms), there is a paucity of studies systemically examining its impact on whole organisms or throughout the entire course of life utilizing in vivo model systems. Thus, here in this study, we conducted a series of experiments to investigate if jujube fruit can modify an organism’s longevity using a live Drosophila model. We found that jujube fruit feeding extended not only lifespan but also healthspan examined by stress assays such as starvation and paraquat treatment. In an effort to shed light on the mechanisms of these jujube-related benefits at the molecular level, we report that messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of 14-3-3ε, a negative FoxO (Forkhead box O transcription factor) regulator, was dramatically diminished while the abundance of d4E-BP mRNA transcript (drosophila eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein), a FoxO target gene, was increased, suggesting enhanced FoxO activity with jujube fruit feeding.

Females showed clear age-dependence in both laying date and number of eggs laid. We found that female reproductive performance improved in early life, before showing a decline. Longer-lived females had an earlier laying date throughout their lives than shorter-lived females, but there was no difference in number of eggs laid between longer- and shorter-lived females. Within breeding pairs, the female's (age-specific) reproductive performance was not dependent on the age and longevity of the male partner.

Notably, age-associated DNA methylation changes comprise a so-called aging ""clock"", a robust biomarker of aging. However, while genetic, dietary and drug interventions can extend lifespan, their impact on the epigenome is uncharacterised. To fill this knowledge gap, we defined age-associated DNA methylation changes at the whole-genome, single-nucleotide level in mouse liver and tested the impact of longevity-promoting interventions, specifically the Ames dwarf Prop1 df/df mutation, calorie restriction and rapamycin. Results: In wild-type mice fed an unsupplemented ad libitum diet, age-associated hypomethylation was enriched at super-enhancers in highly expressed genes critical for liver function. Genes harbouring hypomethylated enhancers were enriched for genes that change expression with age. Hypermethylation was enriched at CpG islands marked with bivalent activating and repressing histone modifications and resembled hypermethylation in liver cancer. Age-associated methylation changes are suppressed in Ames dwarf and calorie restricted mice and more selectively and less specifically in rapamycin treated mice. Conclusions: Age-associated hypo- and hypermethylation events occur at distinct regulatory features of the genome. Distinct longevity-promoting interventions, specifically genetic, dietary and drug interventions, suppress some age-associated methylation changes, consistent with the idea that these interventions exert their beneficial effects, in part, by modulation of the epigenome.

This clock can be hastened by conditions that decrease lifespan, raising the question of whether it can also be slowed, for example, by conditions that increase lifespan. Mice are particularly appealing organisms for studies of mammalian aging; however, epigenetic clocks have thus far been formulated only in humans. Results: We first examined whether mice and humans experience similar patterns of change in the methylome with age. We found moderate conservation of CpG sites for which methylation is altered with age, with both species showing an increase in methylome disorder during aging. Based on this analysis, we formulated an epigenetic-aging model in mice using the liver methylomes of 107 mice from 0.2 to 26.0 months old. To examine whether epigenetic aging signatures are slowed by longevity-promoting interventions, we analyzed 28 additional methylomes from mice subjected to lifespan-extending conditions, including Prop1df/df dwarfism, calorie restriction or dietary rapamycin. We found that mice treated with these lifespan-extending interventions were significantly younger in epigenetic age than their untreated, wild-type age-matched controls.

Males that out-compete others will acquire more mating opportunities and thus have higher lifetime reproductive success. Females that mate with a high quality male receive either direct benefits through productivity or acquisition of additional resources or indirect benefits through the increased fitness of offspring. These components may be in conflict: factors that increase offspring fitness may decrease a female’s productivity, and alleles that are beneficial in one sex may be detrimental in the opposite sex. Here, we use a multigenerational study with recently caught strains of Drosophila melanogaster to examine the relationship between parental, male offspring, and female offspring fitness when fitness is measured in a basal non-competitive environment. Results: We find synergy between parental and offspring lifetime reproductive success, indicating a lack of parent-offspring conflict, and a synergy between son and daughter reproductive success, indicating a lack of intersexual conflict. Interestingly, inbreeding significantly reduced the lifetime reproductive success of daughters, but did not have a significant effect on short-term productivity measures of daughters, sons or parents. Conclusions: In wild-caught flies, there appears to be no parent-offspring conflict or intersexual conflict for loci influencing offspring production in a anon-competitive environment. Further, there may not be a biologically relevant selection pressure for avoidance of inbreeding depression in wild-type individuals of this short-lived species. © 2017 The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011357427

Although individuals born small for gestational age (SGA) may be related to those epigenetic changes, the assessment of LTL in individuals born SGA has yielded conflicting results (only cross-sectional studies) and has not been carried out in longitudinal studies. We performed a birth cohort study to evaluate the rate of telomere erosion in women born SGA in comparison to women born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) assessed at two different time points during the third decade of life. In our research, born SGA or AGA showed no difference in LTL shortening during a period of five years in the third decade of life. Our finding may have implications for understanding the natural history of diseases in lifespan because the same women (under the influence of similar environmental factors) may be accessed in different phases of life. Thus, the analysis of the present cohort population at a more advanced age may reveal a dynamics of telomere shortening different from here and its possible relation with onset of age-related diseases. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007518253

In fact, life expectancy of developed countries is currently over the age of 70. Aging implies a series of physical, psychological, cognitive and social changes that condition one's self-concept, creating adaptive strategies and the knowledge to maintain one's well-being in spite of the changes. Albeit aging is a natural and inevitable process, the benefits of physical fitness on physical and functional deterioration have been thoroughly confirmed. However, although this information is widely known, the majority of elderly people of these countries execute little practice of physical activity in order to improve their Quality of Life (QoL). In response to this attitude, the aim of this paper is to argue and justify that a healthy aging process is associated with maintained health, physical and cognitive function and social participation. It shows numerous research studies which demonstrate that integrated programs of physical fitness can provide benefits in a number of predictors of QoL, such as physical functioning, physical role, general health and social functioning, self-perceived QoL and mental components.

We investigated associations between parental age and nine adverse offspring outcomes in three correlated domains: (i) Premature death: suicide, unnatural death, natural death; (ii) Psychiatric morbidity: any mental illness, suicide attempt, substance misuse; (iii) Criminality: violent offending, imprisonment, driving whilst intoxicated. Methods Persons born in Denmark 1966–1996 were followed from their 15th until 40th birthday or December 2011 (N=1,793,681). Incidence rate ratios were estimated. Results Offspring of teenage mothers had the greatest risks for all nine adverse outcomes, especially for imprisonment, violent offending, substance misuse, and attempted suicide. Teenage fatherhood was also associated with elevated risks for offspring adverse psychiatric and criminality outcomes, but not premature mortality (at ages 15–39 years). For the psychiatric and criminality outcomes there was a U-shape trend linked with paternal age, but risks for premature mortality tended to increase with rising paternal age. On the contrary, maternal age 30 years and over was not linked with raised risks for any of the outcomes examined. Limitations Parental links are based on legal and not biological relationships. Conclusions The substantially elevated risks linked with teenage motherhood for a variety of poor offspring outcomes is a concern for clinicians and policymakers.

Ageing is the biggest risk factor for cancer, which is a leading cause of deaths worldwide. Unfortunately, research describing how genetic variants affect cancer progression commonly neglects to account for the ageing process. Herein is the first systematic analysis that combines a large longitudinal data set with a targeted candidate gene approach to examine the effect of genetic variation on survival as a function of age in cancer patients. Survival was significantly decreased in individuals with heterozygote or rare homozygote (i.e. variant) genotypes compared to those with a common homozygote genotype (i.e. wild type) for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs11574358 and rs4147918), one gene (SIRT3) and one pathway (FoxO signalling) in an age-dependent manner. All identified genes and pathways have previously been associated with ageing and cancer. These observations demonstrate that there are ageing-related genetic elements that differentially affect mortality in cancer patients in an age-dependent manner. Understanding the genetic determinants affecting prognosis differently with age will be invaluable to develop age-specific prognostic biomarkers and personalized therapies that may improve clinical outcomes for older individuals. © Doherty et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032741215

Captive populations provide a unique opportunity to test these explanations because several mechanisms that result in age-related improvements in competence are managed. We modelled the effect of age and experience on the reproductive success of captive migrant Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus L., 1766) subspecies (formerly Lanius ludovicianus migrans W. Palmer, 1898). Female shrikes had the highest reproductive success during mid-life and lower success at 1–2 years of age and over 10 years. Both experienced male and female shrikes had higher fledgling success than inexperienced individuals. Although captive populations breed in controlled settings with few limitations, this work suggests that both explanations (i.e., trade-offs and age-related improvements in competence) are important for understanding reproductive success. Furthermore, management of the captive shrike population can be informed by these relationships to maximize the number of young produced for release to supplement the wild population. © remains with the author(s) or their institution(s).",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027053312

The pineal gland influences the sustenance and function of thymus, the neonatal removal of thymus as well as pineal gland causes the total collapse of the immune system. Involution of pineal and/or thymus after adolescence permits the manifestation of autoimmune processes, causing the aging and determining the lifespan. Thymus involution is not a consequence of the general involution caused by the progressing age, but a prime mover of it. The pacemaker of aging could be in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, which is in neural and chemical contact with the the pineal body and the executor is the thymus, regulating the autoimmunity. From this aspect aging is caused by the continuous slow wearing of cells and organs by autoimmunity. A certain degree of autoimmunity is a natural process, which causes manifest disease if becomes enormously strong or directed towards a special organ or system. The velocity of the slow wearing as well, as the functional importance of the target organs determines the lifespan.

The aim of this study was to test for age-related patterns in fecundity, nest-site location, offspring condition and brood sex ratio in a long-lived colonial waterbird, the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis). For this purpose we collected data on 180 breeding attempts of 100 Great Cormorants aged two to 11 years. We found a progressive increase in reproductive output with age and we showed that older individuals nested closer to the colony centre and in higher nesting densities. We also found that parental age was positively related to physiological condition of offspring (measured with whole-blood haemoglobin concentration and plasma glucose concentration). There was no indication for age-related adjustments in brood sex ratio in our cormorant population.

Thus, the understanding of the effects of age and/or environmental conditions on variability in vital rates is of special importance in ecological and evolutionary studies. Early age-related improvements in survival and reproduction and later declines due to senescence are expected, above all in long-lived species. Survival in these species is predicted to be a more conservative parameter than reproduction, thereby giving rise to less temporal variability. We studied age-dependent patterns of survival and breeding success in a long-lived seabird, the Mediterranean Storm Petrel Hydrobates pelagicus melitensis, and the additive influence of individual heterogeneity and environmental climatic variables using 22 years of individual-based data (1993–2014). The North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) and sea surface temperature (SST) were selected as proxies of environmental conditions in both breeding and wintering areas. Our results show that vital rates improved with age for both survival and breeding success. A slow effect of senescence at older ages was detected for breeding success, whereas models did not disentangle the occurrence or the absence of actuarial senescence. Reproduction was also influenced by the age of first observed reproduction: at the same age, more experienced birds that recruited earlier had a higher breeding success than less experienced ones. Breeding success (but not survival) also showed great temporal variability in accordance with theoretical predictions. Neither the NAO nor the SST explained this variability, probably because petrels feed on lower trophic levels than most pelagic seabirds and other physical features such as river runoffs and winds may be involved, as well as other environmental stressors such as predation by sympatric gulls. © 2016, Dt.

To address this shortcoming, we conducted a series of experiments simultaneously quantifying the effects of age and sexual experience on the use of aggression in male fruit flies. We studied three types of aggression relevant to male fruit flies' natural history: fighting in the context of resource defence, forced copulation with newly eclosed females, and coercion of recently mated females. Young, sexually mature flies were initially reluctant to use aggression towards either males or females. Within a few days, however, their use of aggression increased and then plateaued. While sexual experience caused males to decrease aggression towards females, it did not affect their aggression towards males. It is likely that aggression involves some cost, which leads males to favour peaceful over aggressive pursuit of females. However, sexually experienced males are probably highly motivated to deter other males from their apparently attractive resource. Our results highlight the importance of studying multiple types of aggression and the need for careful assessments of the relative fitness benefits and costs of aggression versus peaceful alternatives in shaping the life history of aggression. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006705602

Methods: This was a prospective study of postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative recruited from 1993 to 1998 and followed until the last outcomes evaluation on August 29, 2014. Participants included 16,251 women born on or before August 29, 1924 for whom survival to age 90 during follow-up was ascertained. Women were classified as having survived to age 90 (exceptional longevity) or died before age 90. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations of ages at menarche and menopause (natural or surgical) and reproductive lifespan with longevity, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive characteristics. Results: Participants were on average aged 74.7 years (range, 69-81 y) at baseline. Of 16,251 women, 8,892 (55%) survived to age 90. Women aged at least 12 years at menarche had modestly increased odds of longevity (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.19). There was a significant trend toward increased longevity for later age at menopause (natural or surgical; Ptrend=0.01), with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.19 (1.04-1.36) and 1.18 (1.02-1.36) for 50 to 54 and at least 55 compared with less than 40 years, respectively. Later age at natural menopause as a separate exposure was also significantly associated with increased longevity (Ptrend=0.02). Longer reproductive lifespan was significantly associated with increased longevity (Ptrend=0.008). The odds of longevity were 13% (OR 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.25) higher in women with more than 40 compared with less than 33 reproductive years.

The apparent survival rate of adult individuals was determined using two methods: according to the ratio of males’ age and the CJS model (Lebreton et al., 1992; Bursky, 2011). A total of 713 captures of 657 individuals were analyzed. The ratios of ages in the males from the sites studied did not differ; yearlings amounted to 56% of all males.

However, our understanding of the association between immunity and fitness in nature remains limited due to both the complexity of the vertebrate immune system and the often-limited availability of immune reagents in nonmodel organisms. Here, we use methods and reagents developed by veterinary researchers for domestic ungulates on blood samples collected from a wild Soay sheep population, to evaluate an unusually broad panel of immune parameters. Our evaluation included different innate and acquired immune cell types as well as nematode parasite-specific antibodies of different isotypes. We test how these markers correlate with one another, how they vary with age-group and sex, and, crucially, whether they predict overwinter survival either within or among demographic groups. We found anticipated patterns of variation in markers with age, associated with immune development, and once these age trends were accounted for, correlations among our 11 immune markers were generally weak. We found that females had higher proportions of naïve T cells and gamma–delta T cells than males, independent of age, while our other markers did not differ between sexes. Only one of our 11 markers predicted overwinter survival: sheep with higher plasma levels of anti-nematode IgG antibodies were significantly more likely to survive the subsequent high mortality winter, independent of age, sex, or weight. This supports a previous finding from this study system using a different set of samples and shows that circulating antibody levels against ecologically relevant parasites in natural systems represent an important parameter of immune function and may be under strong natural selection. Our data provide rare insights into patterns of variation among age- and sex groups in different T-cell subsets and antibody levels in the wild, and suggest that certain types of immune response—notably those likely to be repeatable within individuals and linked to resistance to ecologically relevant parasites—may be most informative for research into the links between immunity and fitness under natural conditions. © 2016 The Authors.

We found that mammals from zoo populations generally lived longer than their wild counterparts (84% of species). The effect was most notable in species with a faster pace of life (i.e. a short life span, high reproductive rate and high mortality in the wild) because zoos evidently offer protection against a number of relevant conditions like predation, intraspecific competition and diseases. Species with a slower pace of life (i.e. a long life span, low reproduction rate and low mortality in the wild) benefit less from captivity in terms of longevity; in such species, there is probably less potential for a reduction in mortality. These findings provide a first general explanation about the different magnitude of zoo environment benefits among mammalian species, and thereby highlight the effort that is needed to improve captive conditions for slow-living species that are particularly susceptible to extinction in the wild. © The Author(s) 2016.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994681072

Such effects have mainly been studied in matrilineal and in “age positive” hierarchies, which are stable and in which high ranking females often outperform low ranking ones. These relationships are less well-understood in age-inversed dominance hierarchies, in which a female's rank changes over time. We analyzed demographic data of 2 wild, unprovisioned groups of gray langurs (Semnopithecus schistaceus) near Ramnagar, Nepal covering periods of 5 years each. Female rank was unstable and age-inversed. We measured reproductive success via birth rates (57 births), infant survival (proportion of infants surviving to 2 years) and number of offspring surviving to 2 years of age (successful births) for 3 age and 3 rank classes. We found that old females performed significantly worse than expected (birth rate P = 0.04; successful births P = 0.03). The same was true for low ranking females (P = 0.04, and P < 0.01, respectively). Infant survival was highest for young and middle-aged as well as for high and middle ranking females. Overall, the results for these unstable hierarchies were rather similar to those for stable hierarchies of other mammals, particularly several nonhuman primates. Compared to a provisioned population of a closely related species, the wild and unprovisioned population examined (i) showed stronger age effects, while (ii) female reproductive success was equally affected by rank.

To understand the interplay among genetic differences, chronological age, and acute exercise we performed microarray-based gene expression analyses in skeletal muscle with a 2×2×2 design to simultaneously compare HCR and LCR, old and young animals, and rest and exhaustion. Transcripts for mitochondrial function are expressed higher in HCRs than LCRs at both rest and exhaustion and for both age groups. Expression of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix genes tend to decrease with age. This and other age effects are more prominent in LCRs than HCRs, suggesting that HCRs have a slower aging process and this may be partly due to their better metabolic health. Strenuous exercise mainly affects transcription regulation and cellular response. The effects of any one factor often depend on the other two. For example, there are ~140 and ~110 line-exercise ""interacting"" genes for old and young animals, respectively. Many genes highlighted in our study are consistent with prior reports, but many others are novel. The gene- and pathway-level statistics for the main effects, either overall or stratified, and for all possible interactions, represent a rich reference dataset for understanding the interdependence among lines, aging, and exercise. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994591115

These hormones may act as an adaptive mechanism, allowing offspring to be 'pre-programmed' to survive in an unstable environment. Here, we used a transgenerational approach to examine the effects of elevated maternal corticosterone (CORT) on the future reproductive success of female offspring. We show that female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) exposed to embryonic CORT produce daughters that have equal reproductive success (clutch sizes, fertility, hatching success) compared with the daughters produced from untreated mothers, but their offspring had accelerated post-hatching growth rates and were significantly heavier by nutritional independence. Although there was no significant effect on primary offspring sex ratio, females from CORT-treated mothers produced significantly female-biased clutches by nutritional independence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of a transgenerational sex ratio bias in response to elevated maternal CORT in any avian species. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Previous isotope analyses have recorded pervasive enrichment or depletion of heavy isotopes in various organisms, strongly supporting the capability of biological systems to distinguish different isotopes. This capability has recently been found to lead to general decline of heavy isotopes in metabolites during yeast aging. Conversely, supplementing heavy isotopes in growth medium promotes longevity.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) provides modest benefit in presymptomatic patients but is well short of a cure. Gene transfer experiments using viral vectors have shown some success in extending the survival in the mouse model of GLD, twitcher mice. The present study compares three single-stranded (ss) AAV serotypes, two natural and one engineered (with oligodendrocyte tropism), and a self-complementary (sc) AAV vector, all packaged with a codon-optimized murine GALC gene. The vectors were delivered via a lumbar intrathecal route for global CNS distribution on PND10–11 at a dose of 2 × 1011 vector genomes (vg) per mouse. The results showed a similar significant extension of life span of the twitcher mice for all three serotypes (AAV9, AAVrh10, and AAV-Olig001) as well as the scAAV9 vector, compared to control cohorts. The rAAV gene transfer facilitated GALC biodistribution and detectable enzymatic activity throughout the CNS as well as in sciatic nerve and liver. When combined with BMT from syngeneic wild-type mice, there was significant improvement in survival for ssAAV9. Histopathological analysis of brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve showed significant improvement in preservation of myelin, with ssAAV9 providing the greatest benefit. In summary, we demonstrate that lumbar intrathecal delivery of rAAV/mGALCopt can significantly enhance the life span of twitcher mice treated at PND10–11 and that BMT synergizes with this treatment to improve the survival further. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990180427

In this study, we carried out metabolic profiling of a worldwide collection of rice accessions and demonstrated that there are substantial variations in jasmonate levels among these accessions.

We also investigated the possible effects of environment, dietary regime and ageing on the gut community composition. We employed culture independent and dependent approaches to characterise vector microbiota. There was evidence of a lifelong stable core microbiota after mosquitoes were released into an urban settlement, where they presumably fed on a range of vertebrate hosts and carbohydrate sources. This core was formed mainly of bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas and Stenotrophomonas and to the families Oxalobacteraceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Comamonadaceae. We showed that both dietary regime and age were associated with the abundance of some bacterial groups in the Ae. aegypti microbiota. The majority of the bacterial groups we identified have been detected in the midgut of Ae. aegypti from laboratory and wild populations, indicating a possible core microbiota associated with this mosquito species.

In particular, the trade-offs between reproduction and longevity and between present and future reproduction are believed to be important in shaping reproductive patterns. Unfortunately, exploring such trade-offs in natural populations is complicated and may not be possible in all taxa. Against this background we here use zoo data for enhancing our understanding of reproductive patterns in two endangered and cryptic deer species (Vietnamese sika deer Cervus nippon pseudaxis, Mesopotamian fallow deer Dama dama mesopotamica). In both species, births peaked right before the onset of the rainy season in the species' natural environments. Females reached high reproductive output earlier in life and had (in one species only) higher survival rates than males. Offspring number covaried positively rather than negatively with longevity. In females, the length of the reproductive phase correlated positively with longevity, birth rate within the entire lifespan, and offspring number, while it was negatively related to the birth rate during the reproductive phase (in 1 species). The length of the post-reproductive phase was positively related to longevity and negatively to the birth rate during the entire lifespan. Taken together, we revealed several patterns being presumably of ecological relevance including indications for trade-offs among offspring quality and quantity, and between present and future reproduction even within these captive populations relieved from seasonal (e.g. food) constraints.

However, from the population perspective, increased reproductive success with age could be a consequence of within-individual variation (e.g. ageing, breeding experience, foraging ability hypotheses), between-individual variation (e.g. individual heterogeneity, frailty, selection, delayed breeding hypotheses), or a combination thereof. We evaluated within- and between-individual variation in reproductive success of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse), a galliforme of conservation concern throughout western North America. We monitored female reproductive activity from 1998–2010 and used generalized linear mixed models incorporating within-subject centering to evaluate and separate within- and between-individual effects. We detected positive effects of within-individual variation on nest initiation and success where ageing increased the likelihood of both parameters, which appears to support the breeding experience and/or foraging ability hypotheses. However, nest initiation was also affected by between-individual variation whereby the likelihood of initiation was higher for individuals with higher mean age (i.e. survived longer), as is predicted by the frailty and selection hypotheses. Our results indicate both within- and between-individual variation affect reproductive output of sage-grouse, but the effects of each varied by measure of reproductive output. Our results corroborate previous findings that suggest population age parameters (i.e. cross-sectional) should be interpreted with caution due to potential entanglement of within- and between-individual processes. Moreover, the relative role and strength of within- and between-individual processes appeared to vary by measure of reproductive output in our results, which further emphasizes the need for longitudinal analysis of age effects, even in relatively short-lived iteroparous animals, to adequately interpret biological processes. © 2016 The Authors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963963360

Prevalence was high among younger adults and declined steeply until ca 4 years of age, after which it was stable. Contrary to expectations, H. nucleocondensus prevalence did not increase among elderly individuals and we found no evidence that annual survival was lower in individuals suffering from an infection.

We observed increased wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and improved markers of healthspan upon treatment with Alaskan blueberry, lowbush cranberry, and chaga extracts.

First, inbreeding depression may vary with ecological or physiological stress and only be detectable over long time periods. Second, parental homozygosity may indirectly affect offspring fitness, thus confounding analyses that consider offspring homozygosity alone. Finally, measurement of inbreeding coefficients, survival and reproductive success may often be too crude to detect inbreeding costs in wild populations. Telomere length provides a more precise measure of somatic costs, predicts survival in many species and should reflect differences in somatic condition that result from varying ability to cope with environmental stressors. We studied relative telomere length in a wild population of Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis) to assess the lifelong relationship between individual homozygosity, which reflects genome-wide inbreeding in this species, and telomere length. In juveniles, individual homozygosity was negatively associated with telomere length in poor seasons. In adults, individual homozygosity was consistently negatively related to telomere length, suggesting the accumulation of inbreeding depression during life.

Oxidative damage is expected to increase with age as a consequence of changes in the optimal investment in defences or repair, and/or because of senescence in antioxidant defence systems, although the pattern might differ between short and long-lived species. However, data on age-related changes in damage levels in wild populations are rare. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal data collected over 3 years, we examine variation in a measure of oxidative damage exposure in known age, wild European Shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), a relatively long lived species. The cross-sectional data showed a quadratic relationship between oxidative damage exposure and age: both relatively young and old adults had higher levels than those in middle age. In contrast, a measure of non-enzymatic antioxidant levels did not vary with age. The cross-sectional increase in oxidative damage exposure in later life was consistent with longitudinal patterns observed within older birds (more than 10 years old). However, the apparent decline in oxidative damage in early adulthood was not consistent with longitudinal patterns in younger birds, which showed individual variation but no consistent age-related change in the marker. This suggests that cross-sectional patterns reflect instead higher disappearance of individuals with high exposure to oxidative damage at this life stage. Our data further show that oxidative damage levels are predictive of attendance at the colony in all age classes: juveniles fledging with a high damage exposure index were less likely to be resighted in the breeding colony 2 years later, and adults with high levels at the end of the breeding season had reduced return rates, irrespective of age. Since this is a species that shows high colony fidelity, this is likely to reflect mortality patterns. These data suggest that exposure to oxidative damage increases with age in a long lived species, but only in later life, when high investment in reproduction at the cost of defence would be predicted. © 2015 The Authors.

Gompertz regression models (N = 7,716) revealed that the offspring of mothers who were naturally fertile until a relatively advanced age lived significantly longer. This observed positive effect of late reproduction was not independent of but conditional upon survival of the mother to the end of her fecundity (defined as age 50). Offspring’s relative risks at death beyond age 50 were 6–12 percent lower than those of their counterparts born to mothers who had an average age at last birth. Our results, which account for various early, adult, and later-life conditions, as well as shared frailty, suggest that there is a positive relationship between mother’s age at last birth and offspring longevity, and strengthen the notion that age at menopause is a good predictor of this relationship. © Society for Biodemography and Social Biology.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976448173

Based on 37 years longitudinal monitoring of a long-lived seabird, the wandering albatross, we investigate delayed effects of parental age on offspring fitness components.

Several studies have shown a positive relationship between aging and chronic heart failure (HF). Cardiac apoptosis was found in age-related diseases. We used a traditional Chinese medicine, Alpinate Oxyphyllae Fructus (AOF), to evaluate its effect on cardiac anti-apoptosis and pro-survival. Male eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were segregated into five groups: normal control group (NC), D-Galactose-Induced aging group (Aging), and AOF of 50 (AL (AOF low)), 100 (AM (AOF medium)), 150 (AH (AOF high)) mg/kg/day. After eight weeks, hearts were measured by an Hematoxylin-Eosin (H and E) stain, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-assays and Western blotting. The experimental results show that the cardiomyocyte apoptotic pathway protein expression increased in the D-Galactose-Induced aging groups, with dose-dependent inhibition in the AOF treatment group (AL, AM, and AH). Moreover, the expression of the pro-survival p-Akt (protein kinase B (Akt)), Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-xL) protein decreased significantly in the D-Galactose-induced aging group, with increased performance in the AOF treatment group with levels of p-IGFIR and p-PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol-3’ kinase (PI3K)) to increase by dosage and compensatory performance. On the other hand, the protein of the Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) pathway expression decreased in the aging groups and showed improvement in the AOF treatment group.

Parental environmental effects are reported for the first offspring generation and some studies showed persisting environmental effects in second and further offspring generations. However, the expression of these transgenerational effects proved context-dependent and their reproducibility can be low. Here we study the context-dependency of transgenerational effects by evaluating parental and transgenerational effects under a range of parental induction and offspring evaluation conditions. We systematically evaluated two factors that can influence the expression of transgenerational effects: single- versus multiple-generation exposure and offspring environment. For this purpose, we exposed a single homozygous Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 line to salt stress for up to three generations and evaluated offspring performance under control and salt conditions in a climate chamber and in a natural environment. Parental as well as transgenerational effects were observed in almost all traits and all environments and traced back as far as great-grandparental environments. The length of exposure exerted strong effects; multiple-generation exposure often reduced the expression of the parental effect compared to single-generation exposure. Furthermore, the expression of transgenerational effects strongly depended on offspring environment for rosette diameter and flowering time, with opposite effects observed in field and greenhouse evaluation environments. Our results provide important new insights into the occurrence of transgenerational effects and contribute to a better understanding of the context-dependency of these effects. © 2016 Groot et al.

In a recent paper, Grafen (2015a) argues that Fisher regarded his theorem as justifying individual rather than population fitness maximization. The argument relies on a new definition of fitness in age-structured populations in terms of individual birth and death rates and age-specific reproductive values in agreement with a principle of neutrality. The latter are frequency-dependent and defined without reference to genetic variation. In the same paper, it is shown that the rate of increase in the mean of the breeding values of fitness weighted by the reproductive values, but keeping the breeding values constant as in Price (1972) is equal to the additive genetic variance in fitness. Therefore, this partial change is obtained by keeping constant not only the genotypic birth and death rates but also the mean age-specific birth and death rates from which the age-specific reproductive values are defined. In this paper we reaffirm that the Malthusian parameter which measures the relative rate of increase or decrease in reproductive value of each genotype in a continuous-time age-structured population is the definition of fitness used in Fisher's (1930) FTNS. This is shown by considering an age-structured asexual haploid population with constant age-specific birth and death (or survival) parameters for each type. Although the original statement of the FTNS is for a diploid population, this simplified haploid model allows us to address the definition of fitness meant in this theorem without the complexities and effects of a changing genic environment. In this simplified framework, the rate of change in mean fitness in continuous time is expected to be exactly equal to the genetic variance in fitness (or to the genetic variance in fitness divided by the mean fitness in discrete time), which can be seen as a generalized growth-rate theorem. This theorem is shown to hold with the Malthusian parameter used as the definition of fitness. Moreover, in the same framework, it is shown that a discrete-time version of Grafen's definition may lead to a decrease in mean fitness. In the limit of weak selection with the unit of time proportional to the inverse of the intensity of selection, however, this definition predicts the right population dynamics in agreement with the growth-rate theorem. This clarifies the domain of application of the new definition, at least as far as population dynamics is concerned, and reconciles the new definition with the original one. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951208064

To address the importance of circadian rhythms in the aging process, we generated conditional Bmal1 knockout mice that lacked the BMAL1 protein during adult life and found that wild-type circadian variations in wheel-running activity, heart rate, and blood pressure were abolished. Ocular abnormalities and brain astrogliosis were conserved irrespective of the timing of Bmal1 deletion. However, life span, fertility, body weight, blood glucose levels, and age-dependent arthropathy, which are altered in standard Bmal1 knockout mice, remained unaltered, whereas atherosclerosis and hair growth improved, in the conditional adult-life Bmal1 knockout mice, despite abolition of clock function. Hepatic RNA-Seq revealed that expression of oscillatory genes was dampened in the adult-life Bmal1 knockout mice, whereas overall gene expression was largely unchanged. Thus, many phenotypes in conventional Bmal1 knockout mice, hitherto attributed to disruption of circadian rhythms, reflect the loss of properties of BMAL1 that are independent of its role in the clock.

Using a 32 year capture-mark-recapture dataset on the griffon vulture Gyps fulvus, we examined the demographic patterns of actuarial senescence and the patterns of year-to-year variation in survival rates. We found a significant, surprisingly late, decrease of annual survival probabilities from the age of 28 years onward and divided individual lifetimes into to three categories (juvenile, mid-age and senescent birds). In agreement with the environmental canalization hypothesis, our analyses uncovered 1) higher temporal variation of annual survival probabilities in both the juvenile and senescent age classes compared to the mid-age class and 2) low sensitivity of the population growth rate to the survival of both the juvenile and senescent age classes. Our results further suggested that the temporal variation in the survival of senescent birds might be related to intra-annual changes in air temperature amplitudes. Finally, using population dynamics modeling, we revealed contrasting effects of the inclusion of the senescent age class on predicted population growth, depending on how survival rates were modeled. Altogether, our results demonstrate the existence of a class of senescent birds that exhibit distinct demographic properties compared to juvenile and mid-age classes. © 2016 Nordic Society Oikos.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956586234

Ideally, to understand the mechanisms and implications of ‘carryover effects’, one would need to follow individuals throughout the year, quantify potential environmental causal factors and physiological mediators during multiple life-history stages, and measure downstream fitness. Owing to current limitations of tracking technology, this is impossible for small, long-distance migrants, so indirect methods to characterize carryover effects are required. Corticosterone (CORT) is a suspected physiological mediator of carry-over effects, but when collected from blood it provides only a physiological snapshot at that point in time. When extracted from feathers, however, feather corticosterone (CORTf) provides a measure of responses to stressors from previous, and longer, time periods. We collected feathers grown during two life-history stages (post-breeding and subsequent wintering) from individuals of two age classes of a rapidly declining migratory songbird, the cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea), on their breeding grounds and quantified CORTf concentrations. We then monitored reproduction and survival of individuals and analysed relationships among CORTf and age, body condition and future fitness. Compared with older males, second-year males had higher CORTf concentrations during both stages. When controlling for age and year, body condition at capture was positively related to CORTf concentrations from winter (especially for older birds). However, we found no relationships between CORTf and fitness (as defined by reproduction and survival). Thus, elevated CORT may represent a beneficial physiological response (e.g. hyperphagia prior to migration), particularly for certain life-history stages, and may mediate the condition in which individuals transition between stages. But for those birds that survive migration, subsequent fitness is likely determined by more recent events and local conditions (i.e. on breeding grounds), which have the potential to counteract conditions from the winter. © The Author 2016.

However, because of dearth of biomarkers, it is difficult to quantify the neonatal biological age. Here we sought to quantify and assess the variability in biological age at birth and to better understand how the aging rates before birth are influenced by exposure in intrauterine period by employing a novel epigenetic biomarker of aging (epigenetic clock). We observed that the methylation age at birth was independent of the infant's sex but was significantly influenced by race. Partial correlation analysis showed a significant negative relationship between maternal socioeconomic status and infants' methylation age (rs=-0.48, Ps = 0.005).

Both estimated cell abundance measures and lymphocyte subpopulations in cord blood showed that tobacco exposed group exhibit an altered T cell compartment, specifically substantial loss of naive T cells.

Results: We found that egg size, age at sexual maturity, and mean age increased with decreasing length of the growth season, whereas clutch size showed a converse cline. Body size did not increase with decreasing length of the growth season, but was tightly linked to lifetime activity (i.e. the estimated number of active days during lifetime). Males and females differed in their patterns of geographic variation in growth rates, which may be the result of forces shaping the trade-off between growth and reproduction in different environments.

MARK software was used for the modelling. Eurasian Bittern nests were most vulnerable to depredation at the beginning of the breeding season. This was probably because the reedbed vegetation at this time was not yet dense enough to effectively conceal the nests. There was a positive relationship between nest age and the daily survival rate. Two of the habitat variables analysed were of the greatest significance: Water depth and vegetation density. In the Eurasian Bittern population studied here, nests built over deep water and in dense vegetation had the best chances of survival. The results of this work may be useful in the preparation of plans for the conservation and management of populations of this rare and endangered species. Conservation and restoration efforts that attempt to maintain high water levels will be especially beneficial to this avian species that is dependent on wetland ecosystems for breeding. © 2016 Polak.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977144685

Land and management agencies are employing translocation techniques to restore Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (CSTG) populations. However, establishing self-sustaining populations by translocating grouse often is unsuccessful, owing, in part, to low survivorship of translocated grouse following release. Aims We measured and modelled patterns of CSTG mortality for 150 days following translocation into historic range, to better understand patterns and causes of success or failure in conservation efforts to re-establish grouse populations. Methods We conducted two independent multi-year translocations and evaluated individual and temporal factors associated with CSTG survival up to 150 days following their release. Both translocations were reintroduction attempts in Nevada, USA, to establish viable populations of CSTG into their historic range. Key results We observed a clear temporal threshold in survival probability, with CSTG mortality substantially higher during the first 50 days following release than during the subsequent 100 days. Additionally, translocated yearling grouse exhibited higher overall survival (0.669±0.062) than did adults (0.420±0.052) across the 150-day period and higher survival than adults both before and after the 50-day temporal threshold. Conclusions Translocated CSTG are especially vulnerable to mortality for 50 days following release, whereas translocated yearling grouse are more resistant to mortality than are adult grouse. On the basis of the likelihood of survival, yearling CSTG are better candidates for population restoration through translocation than are adult grouse. Implications Management actions that ameliorate mortality factors for 50 days following translocation and translocations that employ yearling grouse will increase the likelihood of population establishment. © The authors 2016.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973477539

In this study we evaluated growth and survival of 19 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations representing most of the natural range of the species in Europe, growing in a 30-year-old provenance trial in the northeastern Poland. We used cluster analysis to investigate differentiation among those populations in growth and survival. We also used published data on needle morphology and allozyme and DNA marker variation for those same populations to compare groupings of populations based on growth and needle traits and markers. We found significant variation among tested populations in all investigated traits – the largest variation was found for stand volume which integrates information on growth and survival. Variation in growth traits was related to the latitude of population origin with populations from the latitudinal band between 49° N and 54° N showing the best performance. Populations originating from both north and south off of that region showed lower productivity, which for southern provenances resulted from their particularly low survival, reflecting the lack of adaptation to the environment of the research site. Grouping of populations based on growth traits revealed three clusters corresponding to the three latitudinal regions – northern, central and southern. Needle morphological traits were not appropriate as markers of productivity. Clustering of populations based on needle morphology, and especially based on biochemical and molecular markers, did not correspond to the grouping based on growth traits. © 2016, Polska Akademia Nauk.

Here, using a long-term epidemiological study of wild European badgers (Meles meles),we (i) present evidence of a within-individual age-related decline in the response of a key immune-signalling cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFNg), to ex vivo lymphocyte stimulation, and (ii) investigate three putative drivers of individual variation in the rate of this decline (sex, disease and immune cell telomere length; ICTL). That the within-individual rate of age-related decline markedly exceeded that at the population level suggests that individuals with weaker IFNg responses are selectively lost from this population. IFNg responses appeared to decrease with the progression of bovine tuberculosis infection (independent of age) and were weaker among males than females. However, neither sex nor disease influenced the rate of age-related decline in IFNg response. Similarly, while ICTL also declines with age, variation in ICTL predicted neither among- nor within-individual variation in IFNg response. Our findings provide evidence ofwithin-individual age-related declines in immune performance in a wild mammal and highlight the likely complexity of the mechanisms that generate them. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In this review, we begin by surveying the current connections between stress and telomere dynamics. We then lay out the evidence that exposure to stressors in the parental generation influences telomere dynamics in offspring and potentially subsequent generations. We focus on evidence in mammalian and avian studies and highlight several promising areas where our understanding is incomplete and future investigations are critically needed. Understanding the mechanisms that link stress exposure across generations requires interdisciplinary studies and is essential to both the biomedical community seeking to understand how early adversity impacts health span and evolutionary ecologists interested in how changing environmental conditions are likely to influence age-structured population dynamics. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Furthermore, many different factors that cause analogous life-extending effect, so called CR-mimetic factors, have been found. They increase the lifespan of different animal species (repeatedly in invertebrates) and therefore remain in the forefront of anti-aging researches. The aims of this paper is to find an overarching solution for the nature of CR and all CR-mimetic factors and to analyze the consequences following this phenomenon. Methods: The analysis of empirical scientific data, which concern aging process and boundary areas from the point of view of the bioenergetics theory of aging._ Results: ""Anything that affects a living system that slows (accelerates) the rate of cell division entails extending (reducing) life duration"" is this overarching solution. CR is one of such factors that cause a retardation in the rate of cell divisions due to the shortage in ‘construction materials’ necessary for doubling cell mass during reduplication. This put a brake on realization of the aging program. To draw this conclusion, a new concept of the proliferative aging clock based on bioenergetics theory of aging was put forward. This clock governs the rate of the aging process via programmed, proliferativedependent and stepwise bioenergetics decline. Conclusion: The mechanism of the life-extending effect of CR and CR-mimetic factors is not related to that of natural aging, therefore this unable to be the basis for elaboration of radical remedy for senescence. However, both the CR and some of CR-mimetic factors can undoubtedly lead to human life extension: our organism differs from that of the other mammals only slightly. It is the wellbeing and vulnerability of such extended life that are under consideration. To achieve a healthy and unlimited life it is necessary to reprogram gene expression so that cell bioenergetics levels either remain at a previous level after cell division, which will stop aging, or else grow, which will result in organism rejuvenation. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946909373

Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences found on the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Past research indicates that telomere attrition is strongly correlated with inter-specific rates of aging, though these studies cannot distinguish whether telomere attrition is a cause or consequence of the aging process. We extend previous research on this topic by incorporating recent studies to test the hypothesis that telomeres shorten more slowly with age in slow-aging animals than in fast-aging ones. We assembled all studies that have quantified cross-sectional (i.e. between-individual) telomere rates of change (TROC) over the lifespans of wild animals. This included 22 estimates reflecting absolute TROC (TROCabs, bp/yr, primarily measured using the terminal restriction fragment length method), and 10 estimates reflecting relative TROC (TROCrel, relative telomere length/yr, measured using qPCR), from five classes (Aves, Mammalia, Bivalvia, Reptilia, and Actinopterygii). In 14 bird species, we correlated between-individual (i.e. cross-sectional) TROCabs estimates with both maximum lifespan and a phylogenetically-corrected principle component axis (pcPC1) that reflected the slow-fast axis of life-history variation. Bird species characterized by faster life-histories and shorter maximum lifespans had faster TROCabs. In nine studies, both between-individual and within-individual TROC estimates were available (n = 8 for TROCabs, n = 1 for TROCrel). Within-individual TROC estimates were generally greater than between-individual TROC estimates, which is indicative of selective disappearance of individuals with shorter telomeres. However, the difference between within- and between-individual TROC estimates was only significant in two out of nine studies. The relationship between within-individual TROCabs and maximum lifespan did not differ from the relationship of between-individual TROCabs and maximum lifespan. Overall, our results provide additional support for the hypothesis that TROC is correlated with inter-specific rates of aging and complement the intra-specific research that also find relationships between telomere attrition and components of fitness. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946549893

Large nests may signal the parenting ability of nest builders suggesting that nests may have a signaling function. In particular, many raptors build very large nests for their body size. We studied nest size in the goshawk Accipiter gentilis, which is a top predator throughout most of the Nearctic. Both males and females build nests, and males provision their females and offspring with food. Nest volume in the goshawk is almost three-fold larger than predicted from their body size. Nest size in the goshawk is highly variable and may reach more than 600 kg for a bird that weighs ca. 1 kg. While 8.5 % of nests fell down, smaller nests fell down more often than large nests. There was a hump-shaped relationship between nest volume and female age, with a decline in nest volume late in life, as expected for senescence. Clutch size increased with nest volume. Nest volume increased during 1977–2014 in an accelerating fashion, linked to increasing spring temperature during April, when goshawks build and start reproduction.

Density-dependent variation in the age at first breeding has been described as responsible for the long-term persistence of long-lived bird populations on islands. However, sedentary island populations may also benefit from higher survival rates derived from the absence of migration costs, especially for young individuals. Thus, sedentary island populations can mimic a natural experiment to study migration costs. We estimated the age-dependent survival of two sedentary raptors on the island of Menorca (Egyptian vultures Neophron percnopterus and red kites Milvus milvus) and compared these estimates with those reported for other migratory and sedentary populations. In Menorca, Egyptian vultures, but not red kites, showed low levels of human-related mortality resulting in extremely high survival probabilities, probably due to different diet choices and behavioral patterns. Juvenile Egyptian vultures and red kites in the studied population had lower survival probabilities than adults. This difference, however, was smaller than those reported for mainland migrant populations, which showed a lower juvenile survival rate. In fact, between-population comparisons suggested that survival of the young in migrant populations may be triggered by mortality factors in wintering areas. In contrast, adult survival may respond to mortality factors in breeding areas. Our results suggest that raptor species that become sedentary on islands may benefit from higher pre-breeder survival prospects in comparison with their mainland migrant counterparts. This fact, in combination with an earlier age at first reproduction, may facilitate their persistence. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941939813

In the first trial, the offspring sex ratio decreased as the mare or stallion age increased, and the decrease was more marked for the mares than for the stallions. In the second trial, the mares older than 15 years had more fillies than the younger mares, but the stallion age had no effect on the sex of the offspring. The first trial, with a large number of horses, revealed the pattern of the distribution of the sex ratios of offspring according to the parental age in horses, whereas the second trial, with a more restricted number of horses, confirmed the influence of the age of the mare on the offspring sex ratio. We concluded that the parental age affected the offspring sex ratio in horses and that this effect was stronger for the mares than for the stallions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940596701

In the past decades, the number of older parents has increased significantly. While it is widely recognized that oocyte aging poses higher birth and reproductive risk, the exact molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. DNA methylation of 5-cytosine (5mC) and histone modifications are among the key epigenetic mechanisms involved in critical developmental processes and have been linked to aging. However, the impact of oocyte aging on DNA demethylation pathways has not been examined. The recent discovery of Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) family proteins, thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and the demethylation intermediates 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC has provided novel clues to delineate the molecular mechanisms in DNA demethylation. In this study, we examined the cellular level of modified cytosines (5mC, 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC) and Tet/Tdg expression in oocytes obtained from natural and accelerated oocyte aging conditions. Here we show all the DNA demethylation marks are dynamically regulated in both aging conditions, which are associated with Tet3 over-expression and Tdg repression. Such an aberrant expression pattern was more profound in accelerated aging condition. The results suggest that DNA demethylation may be actively involved in oocyte aging and have implications for development of potential drug targets to rejuvenate aging oocytes.

Using German reunification as a natural experiment, we show that spatial variation in health care in East Germany considerably influenced the convergence of East German life expectancy toward West German levels. Method: We apply cause-deleted life tables and continuous mortality decomposition for the years 1982-2007 to show how reductions in circulatory mortality among the elderly affected the East German catch-up in life expectancy. Results: Improvements in remaining life expectancy at older ages were first seen in towns with university hospitals, where state-of-the-art services became available first.

Counter to a long-standing paradigm, tropical songbirds grow at similar overall rates to temperate species but grow wings relatively faster. These growth tactics are favored by predation risk, both in and after leaving the nest, and are facilitated by greater provisioning of individual offspring by parents. Increased provisioning of individual offspring depends on partitioning effort among fewer young because of constraints on effort from adult and nest mortality.

We found no associations between telomere length, skin pentosidine and chronological age in male common gulls (Larus canus), aging from 2 to 30 years.

The local microenvironment may induce epigenetic changes affecting the survival, proliferation, function and senescence of cardiac cells at rest and following the exposure to different stressors. The cellular response to microenvironment is characterized by the release of ions, oxygen free radicals, auto/paracrine factors and RNAs that drive the magnitude of gene reprogramming through the interaction with specific promoters. The epigenetic alterations may act at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level and change cardiac physiological traits. The abnormal DNA methylation underlies the progressive decay of contractile function and the angiogenic ability; while, the histone acetylation promotes the survival, function and proliferation of cardiac cells in the presence of ischemic microenvironment. At least, the expression and secretion of microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs may regulate the threshold to stress tolerance of adult cardiac cells and induce the matrix turnover as well. Natural or synthetic active compounds effectively modulate the epigenetic state of cardiac cells.

However, theoretical predictions for age effects are contradictory and, to our knowledge, we do not know for any wild animal how the quality of offspring is affected by both parents' ages across their lifespans, or whether mothers' and fathers' ages interact. We tackled this question using long-term data on a highly philopatric, insular population of the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). In this species extra-pair paternity is most common in pairs of two young parents or two old parents, implying that these age combinations might prejudice offspring quality. Analysis of the viability of 3,361 offspring of parents up to 21 years old revealed that fledglings with two young parents or two old parents were least likely to become breeders, whereas fledglings with one young parent and one old parent were most likely to do so. For young parents of either sex, offspring viability increased with age of the other parent; for very old parents, it decreased. These effects could be mediated by parents flexibly modifying their investment in offspring in response to their own and their partners̈ ages, but evidence for this was lacking. In 5,343 breeding attempts, although mothers' and fathers' ages independently affected four heavily care-dependent breeding traits at the clutch and nestling stages, their interaction did not affect any trait. The effects of parental age combinations on viability could also be mediated by genes: fledglings with one young parent and one old parent could benefit from greater heterozygosity or better genes. © 2015 Drummond, Rodríguez.

Among them, the following observations can be mentioned. (1) Species were described that show negligible aging. In mammals, the naked mole rat is the most impressive example. This is a rodent of mouse size living at least 10-fold longer than a mouse and having fecundity higher than a mouse and no agerelated diseases. (2) In some species with high aging rate, genes responsible for active organization of aging by poisoning of the organism with endogenous metabolites have been identified. (3) In women, standard deviations divided by the mean are the same for age of menarche (an event controlled by the ontogenetic program) and for age of menopause (an aging-related event). (4) Inhibitors of programmed cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) retard and in certain cases even reverse the development of age-dependent pathologies. (5) In aging species, the rate of aging is regulated by the individual which responds by changes in this rate to changes in the environmental conditions. In this review, we consider point (5) in detail. Data are summarized suggesting that inhibition of aging rate by moderate food restriction can be explained assuming that such restriction is perceived by the organism as a signal of future starvation. In response to this dramatic signal, the organism switches off such an optional program as aging, mobilizing in such a way additional reserves for survival. A similar explanation is postulated for geroprotective effects of heavy muscle work, a lowering or a rise in the external temperature, small amounts of metabolic poisons (hormesis), low doses of radiation, and other deleterious events. On the contrary, sometimes certain positive signals can prolong life by inhibiting the aging program in individuals who are useful for the community (e.g., geroprotective psychological factors). Similarly, dangerous individuals can be eliminated by programmed death due to operation of progeric psychological factors. The interplay of all these signals results in the final decision of the organism concerning its aging – to accelerate or to decelerate this process. Thus, paradoxically, such an originally counterproductive program as aging appears to be useful for the individual since this program can be switched off by the individual for a certain period of time, an action that thereby increases its resources in crucial periods of life. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931385637

TERC knockout (KO) mice had a significantly reduced number of CD11b+ microglia in the dentate gyrus. Because of an even greater reduction in dentate gyrus volume, microglial density was, however, increased. Microglia in TERC KO mice maintained a homogenous distribution and normal expression of CD45 and CD68 and the aging marker, ferritin, but were morphologically distinct from microglia in both adult and old wild-type mice. TERC KO mice also showed increased cellular apoptosis and impaired spatial learning.

Environmental stressors, such as infection and limited food resources, can compromise investment at each breeding attempt. For example, recent data on captive birds showed that increased reproductive effort accelerates ageing. However, the effects of nutritional status and infection on ageing remain unknown. Telomeres function as protective caps at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, and changes in telomere length is a commonly used proxy for ageing. To partially address the mechanisms of ageing following reproduction, we supplemented, medicated or administered a combined treatment to wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) breeding in central Spain during 2012. The nutritional supplement consisted of two different antioxidants, whereas the medication was an antimalarial treatment against blood parasites. We evaluated the effect of these manipulations on reproductive success and parasite loads in the first breeding season, and on changes in telomere length between two consecutive breeding seasons. Supplemented birds showed no reduction in blood parasite infections in 2012, although they exhibited higher body mass and fledging success. The antimalarial drugs reduced infections by several parasite species, but this had no effect on fitness parameters. In the following season, telomeres from supplemented birds had shortened less. Altogether, we found that supplementation with antioxidants provided fitness benefits in the short term and reduced telomere loss a year following treatment.

Recent research has established much of the mechanisms underlying aging in Escherichia coli, including the role of damaged protein aggregates (DPAs) that are transported by diffusion within the nucleoid-free intracellular space, which leads to their polar localization and asymmetric inheritance (i.e. aging). This provides an opportunity to develop a mechanistic model of E. coli and use it to assess the role of this process at the population level. Is there a fitness benefit to asymmetric inheritance of DPAs? Here we explore this question using a multi-level agent-based model, which simulates a population of individual cells, each with a population of individual DPAs. The model is compared to relevant data compiled from four published studies, which shows it reproduces the main patterns observed, including intracellular localization and inheritance of DPAs, their effect on growth rate, differences in growth rate between sibling pairs, under unstressed and heat shock conditions, for wild type and a mutant that partitions DPAs symmetrically. The model is used to estimate population growth rates of the wildtype and mutant, which shows a statistically significant benefit of aging by asymmetric DPA segregation. However, the benefit is very small and probably not relevant in the context of the ecology of the bacteria's primary habitat (the intestinal tract of warm-blooded animals). But, at an evolutionary time scale even this small benefit may be relevant for bacteria with large population sizes and short generation times. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922592659

We show that parental age has sex-specific negative effects on lifetime fitness, using data from a pedigreed insular population of wild house sparrows. Birds whose parents were older produced fewer recruits annually than birds with younger parents, and the reduced number of recruits translated into a lifetime fitness difference.

It remains unclear whether parental age may affect the genetic variance among offspring. To date, such an effect has been reported only in a single study performed in a wild bird population. Here, we provide experimental evidence that the additive genetic variance (VA) observed among offspring may be related to parental age in a wild passerine—the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus). To separate genetic and environmental components of phenotypic variance in nestling body size and immune function we cross-fostered nestlings between pairs of broods born to young and old mothers and used an animal model to estimate VA. We show that the genetic variance in immune response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and body weight among offspring depends on maternal age. VA in response to PHA appeared to be lower among nestlings of older mothers. Such a tendency was not observed for tarsus length. We argue that the lower VA may result either from depletion of additive genetic variation due to selection acting on parents across age classes or from environmental effects confounded with parental age. Thus, our study suggests that parental age may significantly affect estimates of quantitative genetic parameters in the offspring. © 2014, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925543921

We compared the breeding performance and survival of yearling breeders, first-time adult breeders and adult breeders. We found significant differences in breeding performance but not in survival. Yearling breeders had lower breeding success than older individuals but the breeding performance of inexperienced adults did not differ from that of experienced adults. We did not find changes in terminal breeding success since peregrines in their last year of life sustained the performance levels shown in previous years although with increasing variability. We found no evidence that attempting to breed affected survival probability in any age group. We argue that differences in breeding performance are related to age, not to breeding experience, and that there is an age threshold, coincident with the development of adult plumage, after which breeding performance is not affected either by age or experience. Peregrines that start breeding as yearlings are likely to have greater lifetime reproductive success than birds entering the breeding pool as adults. Consequently, such birds may represent a set of high quality individuals.

Global economies and markets are rapidly shifting; the arrival of the Second Machine Age is continually stretching the frontier of innovation and will destroy or modify many jobs over the next two decades or so; the tyranny of distance is contracting; natural resources appear to be more threatened and/or finite; while social structures become increasingly mobile, older and affluent. This combination of complexity and uncertainty bodes ill for sparsely settled rural regions, already constrained by narrow economic bases, the oscillations of seasonal conditions and unstable commodity prices and exchange rates. Their already fragile economies and societies, using Taleb’s terminology, are likely to become more so. Worse still, complexity and uncertainty, married with the enormous spatial heterogeneity and the fragmentation of government, militate against top-down public strategies designed to promote regional development. So is there any place for regional policy in the emerging world order? Taleb’s recent work on antifragility suggests ways forward, especially in the realm of regional self-help guided by a raft of community and business leaders focusing on creating innovative, creative, scientifically literate, highly networked, investment ready and risk accepting cultures.

Here we show that paternal aging reduces both the likelihood that eggs hatch and the rate at which chicks grow, with older males producing the lightest offspring after the first month. Surprisingly, this cost of paternal aging on offspring development is of a similar scale to that associated with maternal aging. Fitting with predictions on germline aging, the sperm of immature males produce the fastest growing offspring.

This accumulation is blunted in animals with an extended reproductive period and accelerated in sterile animals lacking a germline. Uterine proteins are not removed in old post-reproductive animals or in young vulvaless worms, indicating that egg-laying is necessary for their rapid removal in wild-type young animals. Together, these results suggest that age-induced infertility contributes to extracellular protein accumulation in the uterus with age.

While there are a variety of mechanisms that could mediate this effect, changes in the epigenome that occur during aging has been proposed as a potential candidate. Interestingly, epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and sirtuin1 (SIRT1) are necessary for both circadian rhythms and memory. During aging, similar alterations of epigenetic mechanisms occur in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and hippocampus, which are necessary for circadian rhythm generation and memory, respectively. Recently, circadian rhythms have been linked to epigenetic function in the hippocampus, as some of these epigenetic mechanisms oscillate in the hippocampus and are disrupted by clock gene deletion.

However, age-dependent variation in the expressions of sexually selected traits has received less attention, although such variation underpins differences in male competitive abilities and female preference, which are central to sexual selection. In contrast to previous studies focusing on single traits, we used repeated measures of seven sexually selected morphological and behavioral traits in male black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) to quantify the effects of age and life span on their expressions and quantified this variation in relation to male reproductive effort. Trait expression increased with age, but long-lived males had a slower increase and delayed maxima in trait values compared with short- lived males.

By applying generalized additive mixed models to longitudinal individual-based data of the common tern Sterna hirundo, we estimated age-specific annual survival probability, breeding probability and reproductive performance, based on which we calculated age-specific reproductive values. We investigated effects of sex and recruitment age (RA) on each trait. We found age effects on all traits, with survival and breeding probability declining with age, while reproductive performance first improved with age before levelling off. We only found a very small, marginally significant, sex effect on survival probability, but evidence for decreasing age-specific breeding probability and reproductive performance with RA. As a result, males had slightly lower age-specific reproductive values than females, while birds of both sexes that recruited at the earliest ages of 2 and 3 years (i.e. 54% of the tern population) had somewhat higher fitness prospects than birds recruiting at later ages. While the RA effects on breeding probability and reproductive performance were statistically significant, these effects were not large enough to translate to significant effects on reproductive value.

Recent theory predicts a correlation between individual personality and life-history strategy, and from this comes the prediction that personality may predict the intensity of senescence. Here we show that boldness correlates with reproductive success and foraging behaviour in wandering albatrosses, with strong sex-specific differences. Shy males show a strong decline in reproductive performance with age, and bold females have lower reproductive success in later adulthood. In both sexes, bolder birds have longer foraging trips and gain more mass per trip as they get older. However, the benefit of this behaviour appears to differ between the sexes, such that it is only matched by high reproductive success in males. Together our results suggest that personality linked foraging adaptations with age are strongly sex-specific in their fitness benefits and that the impact of boldness on senescence is linked to ecological parameters. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In growing populations, the progressive decline of Hamiltonian forces of selection with age leads to decreasing survival. As actuarial senescence is overcompensated by a high fertility, actuarial senescence should be more intense in species with high reproductive effort, a theoretical prediction that has not been yet explicitly tested across species. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) females have an unusual life-history strategy among large mammals by associating both early and high reproductive effort with potentially long lifespan. Therefore, wild boar females should show stronger actuarial senescence than similar-sized related mammals. Moreover, being polygynous and much larger than females, males should display higher senescence rates than females. Using a long-term monitoring (18 years) of a wild boar population, we tested these predictions. We provided clear evidence of actuarial senescence in both sexes. Wild boar females had earlier but not stronger actuarial senescence than similar-sized ungulates. Both sexes displayed similar senescence rates. Our study indicates that the timing of senescence, not the rate, is associated with the magnitude of fertility in ungulates. This demonstrates the importance of including the timing of senescence in addition to its rate to understand variation in senescence patterns in wild populations. © 2014 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914706128

In plants, the germ line arises from somatic tissues of the flower, necessitating the erasure of chromatin modifications that have accumulated at specific loci during development or in response to external stimuli. If this process occurs inefficiently, it can lead to epigenetic states being inherited from one generation to the next. However, in most cases, accumulated epigenetic modifications are efficiently erased before the next generation. An important example of epigenetic reprogramming in plants is the resetting of the expression of the floral repressor locus FLC in Arabidopsis thaliana. FLC is epigenetically silenced by prolonged cold in a process called vernalization. However, the locus is reactivated before the completion of seed development, ensuring the requirement for vernalization in every generation. In contrast to our detailed understanding of the polycomb-mediated epigenetic silencing induced by vernalization, little is known about the mechanism involved in the reactivation of FLC. Here we show that a hypomorphic mutation in the jumonji-domain-containing protein ELF6 impaired the reactivation of FLC in reproductive tissues, leading to the inheritance of a partially vernalized state. ELF6 has H3K27me3 demethylase activity, and the mutation reduced this enzymatic activity in planta. Consistent with this, in the next generation of mutant plants, H3K27me3 levels at the FLC locus stayed higher, and FLC expression remained lower, than in the wild type. Our data reveal an ancient role for H3K27 demethylation in the reprogramming of epigenetic states in plant and mammalian embryos. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

By tracking the fates of all 701 horses known to have lived on Sable Island, Canada, from 2009 to 2013 (where there is no predation, human interference, or interspecific competition for food), we present a detailed analysis of structured population dynamics with focus on interacting effects of intraspecific competition and weather on reproduction and survival. Annual survival of adult females (0.866 ± 0.107 [x- ± SE]) was lower than that of 3-year-olds (0.955 ± 0.051), although annual fecundity (producing a foal in a year that was observed during our census) was higher in adults (0.616 ± 0.023) compared to 3-year-olds (0.402 ± 0.054). Milder winters and lower densities during gestation increased fecundity. Density negatively impacted survival for all age and sex categories; however, highest adult female survival was observed during high-density years coupled with a harsh winter, the result expected if pregnancy loss during winter or loss of foals in spring improved survival. Three-year-old females, which reproduced at lower rates, experienced higher survival than adults. Our results contrast with a previous study of feral horses that suggested recently feral ungulates might be artificially selected to reproduce even when costs to survival are high.

Biomedical research on humans and laboratory models has documented age and disease related declines in the telomere lengths of leukocytes ('immune cells'), stimulating interest their having a potentially general role in the emergence of immunosenescent phenotypes. However, it is unknown whether such observations generalise to the immune cell populations of wild vertebrates living under ecologically realistic conditions. Here we examine longitudinal changes in the mean telomere lengths of immune cells in wild European badgers (Meles meles). Our findings provide the first evidence of within-individual age-related declines in immune cell telomere lengths in a wild vertebrate. That the rate of age-related decline in telomere length appears to be steeper within individuals than at the overall population level raises the possibility that individuals with short immune cell telomeres and/or higher rates of immune cell telomere attrition may be selectively lost from this population. We also report evidence suggestive of associations between immune cell telomere length and bovine tuberculosis infection status, with individuals detected at the most advanced stage of infection tending to have shorter immune cell telomeres than disease positive individuals. While male European badgers are larger and show higher rates of annual mortality than females, we found no evidence of a sex difference in either mean telomere length or the average rate of within-individual telomere attrition with age. Our findings lend support to the view that age-related declines in the telomere lengths of immune cells may provide one potentially general mechanism underpinning age-related declines in immunocompetence in natural populations. © 2014 Beirne et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907494941

These SNPs increase FKBP51 protein expression through a mechanism involving demethylation of the gene and altered glucocorticoid signaling. Aged animals also display elevated FKBP51 levels, which contribute to impaired resiliency to depressive-like behaviors through impaired glucocorticoid signaling, a phenotype that is abrogated in FKBP5-/-mice. But the age of onset and progressive stability of these phenotypes remain unknown. Moreover, it is unclear how FKBP5 deletion affects other glucocorticoid-dependent processes or if age-associated increases in FKBP51 expression are mediated through a similar epigenetic process caused by SNPs in the FKBP5 gene. Here, we show that FKBP51-mediated impairment in stress resiliency and glucocorticoid signaling occurs by 10 months of age and this increased over their lifespan. Surprisingly, despite these progressive changes in glucocorticoid responsiveness, FKBP5-/-mice displayed normal longevity, glucose tolerance, blood composition and cytokine profiles across lifespan, phenotypes normally associated with glucocorticoid signaling. We also found that methylation of Fkbp5 decreased with age in mice, a process that likely explains the age-associated increases in FKBP51 levels. Thus, epigenetic upregulation of FKBP51 with age can selectively impair psychological stress-resiliency, but does not affect other glucocorticoid-mediated physiological processes. This makes FKBP51 a unique and attractive therapeutic target to treat PTSD and MDD. In addition, aged wild-type mice may be a useful model for investigating the mechanisms of FKBP5 SNPs associated with these disorders. © 2014 PLOS ONE.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906996222

Older individuals often have higher dominance rank, which may reflect a longer lifespan of dominants and/or an increase in social dominance with age. In the latter case, increasing dominance could mitigate physiological senescence. We studied the social careers of free-living jackdaws over a 12 year period, and found that: (i) larger males attained higher ranks, (ii) social rank increased with age within individuals, and (iii) high-ranked individuals had shorter lifespan suggesting that maintaining or achieving high rank and associated benefits comes at a cost. Lastly, (iv) social rank declined substantially in the last year an individual was observed in the colony, and through its effect on resource access this may accelerate senescence. We suggest that behaviour affecting the ability to secure resources is integral to the senescence process via resource effects on somatic state, where behaviour may include not only social dominance, but also learning, memory, perception and (sexual) signalling. Studying behavioural effects on senescence via somatic state may be most effective in the wild, where there is competition for resources, which is usually avoided in laboratory conditions. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

To reveal thesemechanisms, we screened for Arabidopsis mutants impaired in the resetting of stress-induced loss of epigenetic silencing and found that two chromatin regulators, Decrease in DNA methylation1 (DDM1) and Morpheus' Molecule1 (MOM1), act redundantly to restore prestress state and thus erase ""epigenetic stress memory"".

Results from this experiment suggest that the GRxCRR can survive and reproduce in rivers with a high prevalence of M. cerebralis.

No competing interests are declared.STUDY QUESTION: What are the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the transgenerational effect of p,p′-DDE on male fertility?SUMMARY ANSWER: Impaired male fertility with an Igf2 epigenetic defect is transgenerationally inherited upon exposure of p,p′-DDE.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: p,p′-Dichlorodiphenoxydichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE) is one of the primary metabolite products of the ancestral organochlorine pesticide dichlorodiphenoxytrichloroethane. As it is a known anti-androgen endocrine disruptor, it could cause harmful effects on the male reproductive system.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Pregnant rats (F0) were administered with p,p′-DDE or corn oil at the critical time of testis development, i.e. from gestation days 8 to 15. Male and female rats of the F1 generation were mated with each other to produce F2 progeny. To reveal whether the transgenerational phenotype is produced by the maternal or paternal line, F3 progeny were generated by intercrossing control (C) and treated (DDE) males and females of the F2 generation according to the following groups: (i) C-C, (ii) DDE-DDE, (iii) DDE-C and (iv) C-DDE.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Mature sperm and testes were collected from male offspring of the F1-F3 generations for the examination of male fertility parameters, i.e. sperm count and motility, testis histology and apoptosis. Expression of the imprinted genes, H19 and Igf2, was detected by real-time PCR. Igf2 DMR2 methylation was analyzed by bisulte genomic sequencing.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Upon exposure of p,p′-DDE, the male F1 generation showed impaired male fertility and altered imprinted gene expression caused by Igf2 DMR2 hypomethylation. These defects were transferred to the F3 generation through the male germline.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study has examined the effect of p,p′-DDE only on the sperm number and motility and the possible mechanism of Igf2 DMR2 methylation in vivo and thus has some limitations. Further investigation is necessary to focus on the epigenetic effects of p,p′-DDE at the genome level and to include a more detailed semen quality analysis including sperm morphology assessment. © 2014 The Author.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84913596877

The attrition rate up until the 4-year-old assessment was 10%. participants/materials, setting, methods:We measured BP and anthropometrics of 4-year-old singletons born following conventional IVF with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH-IVF, n = 63), or born following modified natural cycle IV (MNC-IVF, n = 52), or born to subfertile couples who conceived naturally (Sub-NC, n = 79). Both IVF and ICSI were performed. Primary outcome measures were the SBP percentiles and diastolic BP (DBP) percentiles. Anthropometric measures included triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness. Several multivariable regression analyses were applied in order to correct for subsets of confounders. The value B is the unstandardized regression coefficient. main results and the role of chance: SBP percentileswere significantly lower in the MNC-IVF group (mean 59, SD 24) than in the COH-IVF (mean 68, SD 22) and Sub-NC groups (mean 70, SD 16). The difference in SBP between COH-IVF and MNC-IVF remained significant after correction for current, early life and parental characteristics (B: 14.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.39 22.79), whereas the difference betweenMNC-IVF and Sub-NC did not.DBPpercentiles did not differ between groups. After correction for early life factors, subscapular skinfold thickness was thicker in the COH-IVF group than in the Sub-NC group (B: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.03 0.53). limitations, reasons for caution: Larger study groups are necessary to drawfirm conclusions. An effect of gender or ICSI could not be properly investigated as stratifying would further reduce the sample size.We corrected for the known differences between MNC-IVF and COH-IVF but it is possible that the groups differ in additional, more subtle parental characteristics. In addition, we measured BP on 1 day only, had no control group of children born to fertile couples (precluding investigating effects of the underlying subfertility) and included singletons only.As COH-IVF is associated with multiple births we may have underestimated cardiometabolic problems after COH-IVF. Finally, multivariable regression analysis does not provide clear insight in the causal mechanisms and we have performed further explorative analyses. wider implications of the findings: Our findings are in line with other studies describing adverse effects of IVF on cardiometabolic outcome but this is the first study suggesting that ovarian hyperstimulation, as used in IVF treatments, could be a causative mechanism. Perhaps ovarian hyperstimulation negatively influences cardiometabolic outcome via changes in the early environment of the oocyte and/or embryo that result in epigenetic modifications of key metabolic systems that are involved in BP regulation. Future research needs to assess further the role of ovarian hyperstimulation in poorer cardiometabolic outcome and investigate the underlying mechanisms. The findings emphasize the importance of cardiometabolic monitoring of the growing number of children born following IVF. study funding/competing interest(s): The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

Some of these loci have unknown functional significance and may mediate the effects of hormonal exposures on breast cancer risk. We examined relationships between breast cancer susceptibility variants and menstrual/reproductive factors using data from two population-based studies. Methods: The first analysis was based on a sample of 1328 women age 20-74 who participated as controls in a case-control study of breast cancer conducted in three U.S. states. We evaluated the associations between age at menarche, age at natural menopause and the reproductive lifespan with 13 previously identified breast cancer variants. Associations were also examined with a genetic score created as the sum of at-risk alleles across the 13 variants. For validation, significant results were evaluated in a second dataset comprised 1353 women age 43-86 recruited as part of a cohort study in Wisconsin. Results: Neither the genetic score nor any of the 13 variants considered individually were associated with age at menarche or reproductive lifespan. Two SNPs were associated with age at natural menopause; every increase in the minor allele (A) of rs17468277 (CASP8) was associated with a 1.12 year decrease in menopause age (p=0.02). The minor allele (G) of rs10941679 (5p12) was associated with a 1.01 year increase in age at natural menopause (p=0.01). The results were not replicated in the validation cohort (B=-0.61, p=0.14 and B=-0.01, p=0.98, respectively). Conclusions: The evaluated variants and reproductive experiences may work through separate pathways to influence breast cancer risk. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894235562

Two opposite changes in life-history traits are predicted in the presence of senescence: either an increase in breeding performance in late age associated with terminal investment or a decrease due to either life-history trade-offs between current breeding and future survival or decreased efficiency at old age. Age variation in several life-history traits has been detected in a number of species, and demographic performances of individuals in a given year are influenced by their reproductive state the previous year. Few studies have, however, examined state-dependent variation in life-history traits with aging, and they focused mainly on a dichotomy of successful versus failed breeding and non-breeding birds. Using a 50-year dataset on the long-lived quasi-biennial breeding wandering albatross, we investigated variations in life-history traits with aging according to a gradient of states corresponding to potential costs of reproduction the previous year (in ascending order): non-breeding birds staying at sea or present at breeding grounds, breeding birds that failed early, late or were successful. We used multistate models to study survival and decompose reproduction into four components (probabilities of return, breeding, hatching, and fledging), while accounting for imperfect detection. Our results suggest the possible existence of two strategies in the population: strict biennial breeders that exhibited almost no reproductive senescence and quasi-biennial breeders that showed an increased breeding frequency with a strong and moderate senescence on hatching and fledging probabilities, respectively. The patterns observed on survival were contrary to our predictions, suggesting an influence of individual quality rather than trade-offs between reproduction and survival at late ages. This work represents a step further into understanding the evolutionary ecology of senescence and its relationship with costs of reproduction at the population level. It paves the way for individual-based studies that could show the importance of intra-population heterogeneity in those processes. © 2013 The Authors.

Variance components among the provenances were large in the stem area and volume (27-33 %) and the branch width (26 %); those among the sites were large in the stem height, diameter, and density (70-81 %); and those of interaction between sites and provenances were small (0-12 %) in all the variables. Principal component analyses showed that eastern provenances exhibited large size of stems and branches at most sites. Growth rate and maximum size at each site were estimated from fitting the stem volume at three ages (12, 31 or 32, and 50 years) to growth curves in logistic functions.

We used multi-state capture-recapture models to measure age-specific survival and recruitment probabilities of piping plovers Charadrius melodus in the Great Lakes region during 1993-2012. This federally endangered population is thoroughly monitored throughout its entire breeding range, minimizing concerns that measures of survival and recruitment are confounded by temporary or permanent emigration. First-year survival (±SE) averaged 0.284±0.019 from mean banding age (9 d) and 0.374±0.023 from fledging age (23 d). Factors that increased first-year survival during the pre-fledging period (9-23 d) included earlier hatching dates, older age at banding, greater number of fledglings atægiven site, and better body condition at time of banding. However, when chicks that died prior to fledging were excluded from analysis, only earlier hatching dates improved first-year survivalestimates. Females hadæhigher probability (0.557±0.066) of initiating breeding at age one than did males (0.353±0.052), but virtually all plovers began breeding by age three. Adult survival was reduced by increased hurricane activity on the southeast U.S. Atlantic coast where Great Lakes piping plovers winter and by higher populations of merlins Falco columbarius. Mean annual adult survival declined from 1993 to 2012, and did not differ between males and females. Enhanced body condition led to higher survival to fledge and early breeding led to improved first-year survival; therefore, management actions focused on ensuring access to quality feeding habitat for growing young and protecting early nests may increase recruitment in this federally endangered population. © 2014 The Authors.

Shorter telomere length in leukocytes was associated crosssectionally with cardiovascular disorders and their risk factors, including pulse pressure and vascular aging, obesity, vascular dementia, diabetes, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (although not in all studies), cellular turnover and exposure to oxidative and inflammatory damage in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It has been proposed that telomere length may not be a strong biomarker of survival in older individuals, but it may be an informative biomarker of healthy aging. The data reveal that telomere dynamics and changes in telomerase activity are consistent elements of cellular alterations associated with changes in proliferative state and in this article these processes are consequently considered as the new therapeutic drug targets for physiological control with advanced drug delivery and nutritional formulations. In particular, the presence of highly specific correlations and early causal relationships between telomere loss in the absence of telomerase activity and replicative senescence or crisis, and from the other side, telomerase reactivation and cell immortality, point to new and important treatment strategies or the therapeutic manipulation during treatment of age related disorders and cancer. Once better controls and therapeutic treatments for aging and age-related disorders are achieved, cellular rejuvenation by manipulating telomeres and enzyme telomerase activity may reduce some of the physiological declines that accompany aging. In this work, we raise and support a therapeutic concept of using non-hydrolyzed forms of naturally occurring imidazoledipeptide based compounds carnosine and carcinine, making it clinically possible that slowing down the rate of telomere shortening could slow down the human aging process in specific tissues where proliferative senescence is known to occur with the demonstrated evidence of telomere shortening appeared to be a hallmark of oxidative stress and disease. The preliminary longitudinal studies of elderly individuals suggest that longer telomeres are associated with better survival and an advanced oral nutritional support with non-hydrolyzed carnosine (or carcinine and patented compositions thereof) and patented N-acetylcarnosine lubricant eye drops are useful therapeutic tools of a critical telomere length maintenance that may fundamentally be applied in the treatment of age-related sight-threatening eye disorders, prolong life expectancy, increase survival and chronological age of an organism in health control, smoking behavior and disease. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923559790

Dietary restriction (DR) is a recognised anti-ageing intervention that extends lifespan and improves health in several organisms. To investigate the role of telomeres and telomerase in haematopoietic ageing, we compared the HSPC profile and clonogenic capacity of bone marrow cells from wild type with telomerase-deficient mice and the effect of DR on these parameters.Compared with young mice, aged wild type mice demonstrated a significant accumulation of HSPCs (1.3% vs 0.2%, P=0.002) and elevated numbers of granulocyte/macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM, 26.4 vs 17.3, P=0.0037) consistent with myeloid ""skewing"" of haematopoiesis. DR was able to restrict the increase in HSPC number as well as the myeloid ""skewing"" in aged wild type mice. In order to analyse the influence of short telomeres on the ageing phenotype we examined mice lacking the RNA template for telomerase, TERC-/-. Telomere shortening resulted in a similar bone marrow phenotype to that seen in aged mice, with significantly increased HSPC numbers and an increased formation of all myeloid colony types but at a younger age than wild type mice. However, an additional increase in erythroid colonies (BFU-E) was also evident. Mice lacking telomerase reverse transcriptase without shortened telomeres, TERT-/-, also presented with augmented haematopoietic ageing which was ameliorated by DR, demonstrating that the effect of DR was not dependent on the presence of telomerase in HSPCs. We conclude that whilst shortened telomeres mimic some aspects of haematopoietic ageing, both shortened telomeres and the lack of telomerase produce specific phenotypes, some of which can be prevented by dietary restriction. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907309451

Humpback whales exemplify this as they have a lifespan comparable to humans, mature sexually as early as 4 years and have no reliable visual age indicators after their first year. Current methods for estimating humpback age cannot be applied to all individuals and populations. Assays for human age have recently been developed based on age-induced changes in DNA methylation of specific genes. We used information on age-associated DNA methylation in human and mouse genes to identify homologous gene regions in humpbacks. Humpback skin samples were obtained from individuals with a known year of birth and employed to calibrate relationships between cytosine methylation and age. Seven of 37 cytosines assayed for methylation level in humpback skin had significant age-related profiles. The three most age-informative cytosine markers were selected for a humpback epigenetic age assay. The assay has an R2 of 0.787 (P = 3.04e-16) and predicts age from skin samples with a standard deviation of 2.991 years. The epigenetic method correctly determined which of parent-offspring pairs is the parent in more than 93% of cases. To demonstrate the potential of this technique, we constructed the first modern age profile of humpback whales off eastern Australia and compared the results to population structure 5 decades earlier. This is the first epigenetic age estimation method for a wild animal species and the approach we took for developing it can be applied to many other nonmodel organisms. © 2014 The Authors.

Whether there exist a common denominator to explain both similarities and differences in these mortality patterns remains an open question. The disposable soma theory, an evolutionary theory of aging, proposes that universal intracellular trade-offs between maintenance/lifespan and reproduction would drive aging across species. The disposable soma theory has provided numerous insights concerning aging processes in single individuals. Yet, which specific population mortality patterns it can lead to is still largely unexplored. In this article, we propose a model exploring the mortality patterns which emerge from an evolutionary process including only the disposable soma theory core principles. We adapt a well-known model of genomic evolution to show that mortality curves producing a kink or mid-life plateaus derive from a common minimal evolutionary framework. These mortality shapes qualitatively correspond to those of Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, medflies, yeasts and humans. Species evolved in silico especially differ in their population diversity of maintenance strategies, which itself emerges as an adaptation to the environment over generations. Based on this integrative framework, we also derive predictions and interpretations concerning the effects of diet changes and heat-shock treatments on mortality patterns. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904436861

Age structure and overlapping generations complicate determinations of individual fitness, contributing to the popularity of alternative methods for measuring natural selection that do not depend upon such measures. The application of regression-based techniques for measuring selection in these situations requires a demographically appropriate, conceptually sound, and observable measure of individual fitness. It has been suggested that Fisher's reproductive value applied to an individual at its birth is such a definition. Here I offer support for this assertion by showing that multiple regression applied to this measure and vital rates (age-specific survival and fertility rates) yields the same selection gradients for vital rates as those inferred from Hamilton's classical results. I discuss how multiple regressions, applied to individual reproductive value at birth, can be used efficiently to estimate measures of phenotypic selection that are problematic for sensitivity analyses.

Relatively little attention has been given to the role of infrequent disturbance events in forest dynamics. In this study, we analyzed dendroecological data from four stands and three windthrow patches in an old-growth landscape in the Dinaric Mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina to examine disturbance history, tree life history traits, and compositional dynamics. Over all stands, most decades during the past 340 years experienced less than 10% canopy loss, yet each stand showed evidence of periodic intermediate-severity disturbances that removed >40% of the canopy, some of which were synchronized over the study area landscape. Analysis of radial growth patterns indicated several life history differences among the dominant canopy trees; beech was markedly older than fir, while growth patterns of dead and dying trees suggested that fir was able to tolerate longer periods of suppressed growth in shade. Maple had the fastest radial growth and accessed the canopy primarily through rapid early growth in canopy gaps, whereas most beech and fir experienced a period of suppressed growth prior to canopy accession. Peaks in disturbance were roughly linked to increased recruitment, but mainly of shade-tolerant beech and fir; less tolerant species (i.e., maple, ash, and elm) recruited successfully on some of the windthown sites where advance regeneration of beech and fir was less abundant. The results challenge the traditional notions of stability in temperate oldgrowth forests of Europe and highlight the nonequilibrial nature of canopy composition due to unique histories of disturbance and tree life history differences. These findings provide valuable information for developing natural disturbance-based silvicultural systems, as well as insight into maintaining less shade-tolerant, but valuable broadleaved trees in temperate forests of Europe. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903530543

Eighty ewes were synchronized in estrus and allocated to two groups (n=40) to be fed diets that provided 1.5 (C) or 0.5 (L) times the requirements for maintenance. Ewes were mated and 7 days later fed the control diet until lambing. One month after lambing, 32 lambs were exposed to tests to determine their cognitive and emotional responses. Six ewe lambs were euthanized and in vitro maturation and fertilization procedures were performed. L ewes presented a significant reduction in prolificacy and fecundity (P<0.05) in comparison with C ewes.

Concurrently, interest in age-dependent effects on survival, including actuarial senescence, has increased, especially in studies of long-lived seabirds. Nevertheless, datasets necessary for studying dispersal and age-dependent effects are few, as these require simultaneous data collection at two or more sites over many years. We conducted a 22-year capture-mark-recapture study of Common Terns Sterna hirundo at three breeding colonies 10-26 km apart in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, USA. All birds in the study were of known age (range 2-28 years, median 7 years, n = 3290) and 77% were of known sex. Estimates of adult recapture, survival and breeding dispersal rates were obtained for all age-classes from 2 to 20 years. The model that acquired 100% of the QAICc (Akaike's Information Criterion adjusted for small sample size and overdispersion) weight in our analysis included age-specificity in all parameters but no relationship with sex. Our study may be the first to demonstrate age-specificity in recapture, survival and breeding dispersal rates simultaneously, using a single model. Annual rates of breeding dispersal ranged from &lt;0.01 to 0.27, with a population-weighted mean of 0.065; they decreased with increasing distance between colony sites and, unexpectedly, increased with age. Breeding dispersal did not increase consistently after years with predation on adults or after an attempt to displace birds from an oiled site. Survival rates did not vary among sites or years. Annual adult survival increased from 0.80 in 2-year-old birds to a maximum of approximately 0.88 around age 8 years and then declined to 0.76 at age 20 years, yielding strong evidence for actuarial senescence. The peak annual survival rate of 0.88 is at the low end of other estimates for Common Tern and in the lower part of the range recorded for other terns, but total numbers in the three colonies increased seven-fold during the study. This was part of a slower increase in the regional population, with net immigration into the study colonies.

Understanding how components of wastewater influence fish populations is necessary for effective conservation and management. Despite research demonstrating effects of oestrogens, such as 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), on fish physiology and population failure, the generality of population responses is uncertain and the underlying mechanisms affecting population declines are unknown. EE2 is the steroid oestrogen in human contraceptive pills and has been measured up to 11 ng L-1 in the environment. We identify disrupted population dynamics due to direct and transgenerational effects on survival and fecundity. We conducted a year-long study on three generations of fathead minnows Pimephales promelas Rafinesque in aquatic mesocosms and laboratory aquaria. We added environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2 daily using a static renewal, which approximates a pulsed exposure that fish experience in natural systems. EE2 (3·2 ng L-1) reduced F0 male survival to 17% (48% lower than controls) and juvenile production by 40% compared to controls. F1 fish continuously exposed to EE2 failed to reproduce, and reproduction of the F1 transferred to clean water was 70-99% less than controls. F2 larval survival, exposed only as germ cells in their parents, was reduced by 51-97% compared to controls. The indirect effect on F2 survival suggests the possibility of transgenerational effects of EE2. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that fish populations exposed to environmentally relevant 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) concentrations may not recover from exposure. Management of short-lived highly fecund fishes should be prioritized to protect fish from the embryo through gonadal differentiation. Reducing effluent will not be possible in many situations; hence, conservation of breeding and rearing habitat in unpolluted tributaries or reaches is needed. Additionally, resource managers could enhance habitat connectivity in rivers to facilitate immigration. Finally, investment in advanced wastewater processing technology should improve removal of bioactive chemicals such as EE2. Our results provide a baseline for regulatory agencies to consider when assessing the ecological effects of environmental oestrogens, and our approach to evaluating population-level effects could be widely applied to other contaminants. © 2014 British Ecological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900563959

However, cross-sectional body burden-age trends (CBATs) obtained from biomonitoring studies, which sample individuals of different ages at the same time, should not be confused with longitudinal body burden-age trends (LBATs) obtained by sampling the same individuals repeatedly through time. To clarify how CBATs and LBATs for wildlife species deviate from each other, and describe any impact of lifespan and sex, we used mechanistic bioaccumulation models to estimate historic longitudinal exposures of polar cod, ringed seals, beluga whales, and bowhead whales to polychlorinated biphenyl congener 153. Cross-sectional body burden-age trends were then produced by sampling resultant LBATs of successive birth cohorts at specific time points. As found previously for humans, the year of sampling relative to the year of peak environmental contamination was a critical parameter in determining male CBAT shapes. However, a similar cohort effect was not apparent for reproductive females because efficient POP loss through lactation prevented their lipids from retaining a memory of past exposure levels. Thus, lactation loss was not only responsible for the large differences between the CBATs of males and females of the same species, but also the lack of female CBAT variability through time. Cross-sectional body burden-age trend shapes varied little between species by lifespan, as long as equivalent age scales were used. However, lifespan relative to the timescale of environmental contaminant level changes did determine the extent to which CBATs resembled LBATs for males. We suggest that accounting for birth cohort and sex effects is essential when interpreting age trends in POP biomonitoring studies of long-lived species.

Taking advantage of a natural disassociation between age and pair bond duration in this species, and applying a novel analytical approach to a 24 year database, we found that those pairs which have been together for longer establish their clutches five weeks earlier in the season, hatch more of their eggs and produce 35% more fledglings, regardless of age and reproductive experience. Our results demonstrate that pair bond duration increases individual fitness and further suggest that synergistic effects between a male and female's behaviour are likely to be involved in generating a mate familiarity effect.

Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including bone. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteoporosis, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to bone aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as models for human bone aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (Wrn-/-), telomerase (Terc-/-) and Wrn-/-Terc-/- double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young Terc-/- and Wrn-/-Terc-/- mice have decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical bone, young Terc-/- and Wrn-/-Terc-/- mice have increased cortical thinning, and increased porosity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in Terc-/- and Wrn -/-Terc-/- mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of osteoblasts in aged mice showed a similar number of osteoblasts in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, mineralization surface, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate in older Terc-/- and Wrn-/-Terc-/- bone suggest that osteoblast dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the Wrn-/- single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure model index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the Terc-/- and Wrn-/-Terc-/- femurs compared with WT mice were also observed. Young Wrn-/-Terc-/- mice had a statistically significant increase in bone-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that Terc-/- and Wrn-/-Terc -/- mutants recapitulate the human bone aging phenotype and are useful models for studying age-related osteoporosis. © 2014.

However, this conflicts with abundant data, showing that resident species body size distributions are usually strongly right-skewed at virtually all scales within vegetation. Using surveys within sample plots and a neighbor-removal experiment, we tested: (1) whether resident species that have a larger maximum potential body size (MAX) generally have more successful local individual recruitment, and thus greater local abundance/density (as predicted by the traditional size-advantage hypothesis); and (2) whether there is a general between-species trade-off relationship between MAX and capacity to produce offspring when body size is severely suppressed by crowding/competition - that is, whether resident species with a larger MAX generally also need to reach a larger minimum reproductive threshold size (MIN) before they can reproduce at all. The results showed that MIN had a positive relationship with MAX across resident species, and local density - as well as local density of just reproductive individuals - was generally greater for species with smaller MIN (and hence smaller MAX). In addition, the cleared neighborhoods of larger target species (which had relatively large MIN) generally had - in the following growing season - a lower ratio of conspecific recruitment within these neighborhoods relative to recruitment of other (i.e., smaller) species (which had generally smaller MIN). These data are consistent with an alternative hypothesis based on a 'reproductive-economy-advantage' - that is, superior fitness under competition in plants generally requires not larger potential body size, but rather superior capacity to recruit offspring that are in turn capable of producing grand-offspring - and hence transmitting genes to future generations - despite intense and persistent (cross-generational) crowding/competition from near neighbors. Selection for the latter is expected to favor relatively small minimum reproductive threshold size and hence - as a tradeoff - relatively small (not large) potential body size. © 2014 The Authors.

To determine the role of mitochondrial morphology changes in age-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, we studied mitochondrial morphology in body wall muscles of the nematode C. elegans. We found that in this tissue, animals display a tubular mitochondrial network, which fragments with increasing age. This fragmentation is accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial volume. Mitochondrial fragmentation and volume loss occur faster under conditions that shorten lifespan and occur slower under conditions that increase lifespan. However, neither mitochondrial morphology nor mitochondrial volume of five- and seven-day old wild-type animals can be used to predict individual lifespan.

Studies on natural vertebrate populations show early reproduction may impair later-life performance, but the consequences for lifetime fitness have rarely been determined, and little is known of whether similar patterns apply to mammals which typically live for several decades. We used a longitudinal dataset on Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) to investigate associations between early-life reproduction and female age-specific survival, fecundity and offspring survival to independence, as well as lifetime breeding success (lifetime number of calves produced). Females showed low fecundity following sexual maturity, followed by a rapid increase to a peak at age 19 and a subsequent decline. High early life reproductive output (before the peak of performance) was positively associated with subsequent age-specific fecundity and offspring survival, but significantly impaired a female's own later-life survival. Despite the negative effects of early reproduction on late-life survival, early reproduction is under positive selection through a positive association with lifetime breeding success. Our results suggest a trade-off between early reproduction and later survival which is maintained by strong selection for high early fecundity, and thus support the prediction from life history theory that high investment in reproductive success in early life is favoured by selection through lifetime fitness despite costs to later-life survival. That maternal survival in elephants depends on previous reproductive investment also has implications for the success of (semi-)captive breeding programmes of this endangered species. © 2014 The Authors.

The attrition rate until the 4-year-old assessment was 10%.PARTICIPANTS/ MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSWe measured blood pressure and anthropometrics of 4-year-old singletons born following COH-IVF (n = 63), or born following modified natural cycle IVF (MNC-IVF, n = 52) or born to subfertile couples who conceived naturally (Sub-NC, n = 79). Primary outcome measures were the SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) percentiles. Anthropometrics included triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness. Causal inference search algorithms and structural equation modeling were applied.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEExplorative analyses suggested a direct effect of COH on SBP percentiles and on subscapular skinfold thickness. This hypothesis needs confirmation with additional, preferably larger, studies.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONSearch algorithms were used as explorative tools to generate hypotheses on the causal mechanisms underlying fertility treatment, blood pressure, anthropometrics and other variables. More studies using larger groups are needed to draw firm conclusions.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSOur findings are in line with other studies describing adverse effects of IVF on cardiometabolic outcome, but this is the first study suggesting a causal mechanism underlying this association. Perhaps ovarian hyperstimulation negatively influences cardiometabolic outcome via changes in the early environment of the oocyte and/or embryo, possibly resulting in epigenetic modifications of key metabolic systems that are involved in BP regulation. Future research needs to confirm the role of ovarian stimulation in poorer cardiometabolic outcome and should investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our proposed causal models provide research hypotheses to be tested with new data from preferably larger studies. © 2013 The Author.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894232222

Interindividual variability of telomere length may partly explain differences in reproductive aging rates. We examined whether leukocyte telomere length was associated with menopausal age. METHODS:: We evaluated the relationship between leukocyte telomere length and age at natural menopause in 486 white women ≥65 years of age. We fit linear regression models adjusted for age, income, education, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake. We repeated the analysis in women with surgical menopause. We also performed sensitivity analyses excluding women (1) with unilateral oophorectomy, (2) who were nulliparous, or (3) reporting menopausal age <40 years, among other exclusions. RESULTS:: For every 1-kb increase in leukocyte telomere length, average age at natural menopause increased by 10.2 months (95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 19.0). There was no association among 179 women reporting surgical menopause. In all but one sensitivity analysis, the association between leukocyte telomere length and age at menopause became stronger. However, when excluding women with menopausal age <40 years, the association decreased to 7.5 months (-0.4 to 15.5). CONCLUSIONS:: Women with the longest leukocyte telomere length underwent menopause 3 years later than those with the shortest leukocyte telomere length. If an artifact, an association would likely also have been observed in women with surgical menopause. If these results are replicated, leukocyte telomere length may prove to be a useful predictor of age at menopause.

Such linkage however has never been reported in fish. Progressive shortening of telomere length is an important aging mechanism. Mounting in vitro evidence has shown that telomere shortening beyond a critical length triggered replicative senescence or cell death. Estrogen has been postulated as a key factor contributing to maintenance of telomere and sex-dependent longevity in animals. This postulation remains unproven due to the lack of a suitable animal system for testing. Here, we introduce a teleost model, the Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes, which shows promise for research into the molecular mechanism(s) controlling sex difference in aging.Results: Using the medaka, we demonstrate for the first time in teleost that (i) sex differences (female > male) in telomere length and longevity also exist in fish, and (ii) a natural, 'menopause'-like decline of plasma estrogen was evident in females during aging. Estrogen levels significantly correlated with telomerase activity as well as telomere length in female organs (not in males), suggesting estrogen could modulate telomere length via telomerase activation in a sex -specific manner. A hypothetical in vivo 'critical' terminal restriction fragment (TRF, representing telomere) length of approximately 4 kb was deduced in medaka liver for prediction of organismal mortality, which is highly comparable with that for human cells. An age conversion model was also established to enable age translation between medaka (in months) and human (in years). These novel tools are useful for future research on comparative biology of aging using medaka.Conclusion: The striking similarity in estrogen profile between aging female O. latipes and women enables studying the influence of "" postmenopausal"" decline of estrogen on telomere and longevity without the need of invasive ovariectomy. Medaka fish is advantageous for studying the direct effect of increased estrogen on telomere length and longevity without the breast cancer complications reported in rodents. The findings strongly support the notion that O. latipes is a unique non-mammalian model for validation of estrogenic influence on telomere and longevity in vertebrates. This laboratory model fish is of potential significance for deciphering the ostensibly conserved mechanism(s) of sex-associated longevity in vertebrates. © 2013 Gopalakrishnan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890732971

It is now clear that animal genomes are regulated to a large extent as a result of input from environmental events and experiences, which cause short- and long-term modifications in epigenetic markings of DNA and histones. In this review, the evidence that such epigenetic modifications can affect the behaviour of animals is explored, and whether such acquired behaviour alterations can transfer across generation borders. First, the mechanisms by which experiences cause epigenetic modifications are examined. This includes, for example, methylation of cytosine in CpG positions and acetylation of histones, and studies showing that this can be modified by early experiences. Secondly, the evidence that specific modifications in the epigenome can be the cause of behaviour variation is reviewed. Thirdly, the extent to which this phenotypically active epigenetic variants can be inherited either through the germline or through reoccurring environmental conditions is examined. A particularly interesting observation is that epigenetic modifications are often linked to stress, and may possibly be mediated by steroid effects. Finally, the idea that transgenerationally stable epigenetic variants may serve as substrates for natural selection is explored, and it is speculated that they may even predispose for directed, non-random mutations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888874877

By counting post-fluorescent mark increments on otoliths from 21 chemically tagged wild fish recaptured 244-537 days later, the deposition of growth zones, comprising alternating opaque and translucent bands, was validated as annual. Examination of sectioned otoliths from 175 fish revealed that the oldest fish, two males of 840 and 1074 mm total length (TL), were 25 years old - 10 years older than previously described for any C. gariepinus population.

Rather than being constant, the strength of density dependence may vary throughout the year, but empirical evidence is limited. Based on 22 years of data of color-banded birds from a recovering population of Eurasian Spoonbills Platalea leucorodia leucorodia, we show, for the first time, seasonal variation in density dependence in survival of a long-distance migrating bird. Combining resightings and dead recoveries at breeding, stopover, and nonbreeding areas enabled us to (1) separate true survival from permanent emigration from the breeding area, and (2) estimate survival in three seasons: summer, early winter (including autumn migration), and late winter (including spring migration). Accompanying the rapid population growth, juvenile annual survival initially increased, manifested in early winter, but thereafter, at high population sizes, it strongly decreased through a combination of decreasing survival in all seasons. Annual survival of subadult (second- and third-year) and adult birds decreased more gradually with increasing population size, with density dependence occurring in early winter for subadults and late winter for adults. Thus, the shape and strength of density dependence in survival varied with age and season. Understanding the seasonal timing of density dependence, especially with reference to underlying mechanisms, is important for the design of effective conservation strategies. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886534651

Here we show that RNA-DNA hybrids form at telomeres and are removed by RNase H enzymes in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In recombination-competent telomerase mutants, telomeric RNA-DNA hybrids promote recombination-mediated elongation events that delay the onset of cellular senescence. Reduction of TERRA and telomeric RNA-DNA-hybrid levels diminishes rates of recombination-mediated telomere elongation in cis. Overexpression of RNase H decreases telomere recombination rates and accelerates senescence in recombination-competent but not recombination-deficient cells. In contrast, in the absence of both telomerase and homologous recombination, accumulation of telomeric RNA-DNA hybrids leads to telomere loss and accelerated rates of cellular senescence. Therefore, the regulation of TERRA transcription and telomeric RNA-DNA-hybrid formation are important determinants of both telomere-length dynamics and proliferative potential after the inactivation of telomerase. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

The enzyme methionine synthase reductase (Mtrr) is necessary for utilization of methyl groups from the folate cycle. We found that a hypomorphic mutation of the mouse Mtrr gene results in intrauterine growth restriction, developmental delay, and congenital malformations, including neural tube, heart, and placental defects. Importantly, these defects were dependent upon the Mtrr genotypes of the maternal grandparents. Furthermore, we observed widespread epigenetic instability associated with altered gene expression in the placentas of wild-type grandprogeny of Mtrr-deficient maternal grandparents. Embryo transfer experiments revealed that Mtrr deficiency in mice lead to two distinct, separable phenotypes: adverse effects on their wild-type daughters' uterine environment, leading to growth defects in wild-type grandprogeny, and the appearance of congenital malformations independent of maternal environment that persist for five generations, likely through transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.

However, it is still unclear how mitochondrial defects arise under normal physiological conditions. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions caused by direct repeats (DRs) are implicated in the formation of mitochondrial defects, however, mitochondrial DRs show relatively weak (Pearson's r = -0.22, p&lt;0.002; Spearman's ρ = -0.12, p = 0.1) correlation with maximum lifespan (MLS).

Telomeres shorten with age in most species and are expected to reflect physiological state, reproductive investment, and chronological age. Loss of telomere length is used as an indicator of biological aging, as this detrimental deterioration is associated with lowered survival. Lifespan dimorphism and more rapid senescence in the larger, shorter-lived sex are predicted in species with sexual size dimorphism, however, little is known about the effects of behavioral dimorphism on senescence and life history traits in species with sexual monomorphism. Here we compare telomere dynamics of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), a species with male-biased parental care, in two ways: 1) cross-sectionally in birds of known-age (0-28 years) from one colony and 2) longitudinally in birds from four colonies. Telomere dynamics are compared using three measures: the telomere restriction fragment (TRF), a lower window of TRF (TOE), and qPCR. All showed age-related shortening of telomeres, but the TRF measure also indicated that adult female murres have shorter telomere length than adult males, consistent with sex-specific patterns of ageing. Adult males had longer telomeres than adult females on all colonies examined, but chick telomere length did not differ by sex. Additionally, inter-annual telomere changes may be related to environmental conditions; birds from a potentially low quality colony lost telomeres, while those at more hospitable colonies maintained telomere length. We conclude that sex-specific patterns of telomere loss exist in the sexually monomorphic thick-billed murre but are likely to occur between fledging and recruitment. Longer telomeres in males may be related to their homogamous sex chromosomes (ZZ) or to selection for longer life in the care-giving sex.

Overall, the likelihood of expressing the ornament increased nonlinearly with female age and was due to within-individual variation, not to the selective appearance or disappearance of ornament-related expression of phenotypes in the population. Accordingly, expressing the forehead patch in a given year did not influence survival probability. However, those females expressing the ornament at early ages (1-2 years old) enjoyed survival advantages throughout lifetime. Although ornamented females had higher lifetime fecundity and fledging success, their yearly reproductive performance, in terms of fledging productivity, decreased as they aged so that, late in life, ornamented females reared fewer offspring than nonexpressing females of the same age.

Fly heads then were removed to quantify pterin levels and estimate fly age, abdomens were dissected to score gonotrophic development and parity (follicular relics), and spermathecae were examined for sperm. Daily survival was assessed using two estimates of time required to become gravid: laboratory-based degree-day (DD) estimates and estimates based on pterin values in field-collected flies matched to their stages of gonotrophic development. Among newly emerged females (oocyte stage 1) with detectable muscalure, it comprised < ≈ 1.5% of cuticular hydrocarbons. In muscalure-positive flies, muscalure comprised a higher proportion of cuticular hydrocarbons in older flies from California and Minnesota (6-9% when gravid) versus flies from Georgia (<2% when gravid). Females mated in early-intermediate stages of egg development. Life expectancy, using laboratory-derived estimates of time needed to become gravid, ranged from 3.6 to 10.6 d. Using equivalent pterin-based time estimates, life expectancy ranged from 4.0 to 19.5 d.

However, while clines in quantitative traits and genetic polymorphisms have been observed within and across continents, few studies have attempted to demonstrate direct links between them. The gene methuselah in Drosophila has been shown to have a major effect on stress response and longevity phenotypes based largely on laboratory studies of induced mutations in the mth gene. Clinal patterns in the most common mth haplotype and for lifespan (both increasing with latitude) have been observed in North American populations of D. melanogaster, implicating climatic selection. While these clinal patterns have led some to suggest that mth influences ageing in natural populations, limited evidence on the association between the two has so far been collected. Here, we describe a significant cline in the mth haplotype in eastern Australian D. melanogaster populations that parallel the cline in North America. We also describe a cline in mth gene expression. These findings further support the idea that mth is itself under selection. In contrast, we show that lifespan has a strong nonlinear clinal pattern, increasing southwards from the tropics, but then decreasing again from mid-latitudes. Furthermore, in association studies, we find no evidence for a direct link between mth haplotype and lifespan. Thus, while our data support a role for mth variation being under natural selection, we found no link to naturally occurring variation in lifespan and ageing in Australian populations of D. melanogaster.

Age-specific (co)variances in reproductive success achieved through different reproductive routes must therefore be quantified to predict population, phenotypic and evolutionary dynamics in age-structured populations. While numerous studies have quantified age-specific variation in mean reproductive success, age-specific variances and covariances in reproductive success, and the contributions of different reproductive routes to these (co)variances, have not been comprehensively quantified in natural populations. We applied 'additive' and 'independent' methods of variance decomposition to complete data describing apparent (social) and realised (genetic) age-specific reproductive success across 11 cohorts of socially monogamous but genetically polygynandrous song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We thereby quantified age-specific (co)variances in male within-pair and extra-pair reproductive success (WPRS and EPRS) and the contributions of these (co)variances to the total variances in age-specific reproductive success and LRS. 'Additive' decomposition showed that within-age and among-age (co)variances in WPRS across males aged 2-4 years contributed most to the total variance in LRS. Age-specific (co)variances in EPRS contributed relatively little. However, extra-pair reproduction altered age-specific variances in reproductive success relative to the social mating system, and hence altered the relative contributions of age-specific reproductive success to the total variance in LRS. 'Independent' decomposition showed that the (co)variances in age-specific WPRS, EPRS and total reproductive success, and the resulting opportunities for selection, varied substantially across males that survived to each age. Furthermore, extra-pair reproduction increased the variance in age-specific reproductive success relative to the social mating system to a degree that increased across successive age classes. This comprehensive decomposition of the total variances in age-specific reproductive success and LRS into age-specific (co)variances attributable to two reproductive routes showed that within-age and among-age covariances contributed substantially to the total variance and that extra-pair reproduction can alter the (co)variance structure of age-specific reproductive success.

In this study we examine DNA methylation at 476,366 sites throughout the genome of white blood cells from a population cohort (N = 421) ranging in age from 14 to 94 years old. Age affects DNA methylation at almost one third (29%) of the sites (Bonferroni adjusted P-value &lt;0.05), of which 60.5% becomes hypomethylated and 39.5% hypermethylated with increasing age. DNA methylation sites that are located within CpG islands (CGIs) more often become hypermethylated compared to sites outside an island. CpG sites in promoters are more unaffected by age, whereas sites in enhancers more often becomes hypo- or hypermethylated. Hypermethylated sites are overrepresented among genes that are involved in DNA binding, transcription regulation, processes of anatomical structure and developmental process and cortex neuron differentiation (P-value down to P = 9.14*10-67). By contrast, hypomethylated sites are not strongly overrepresented among any biological function or process. Our results indicate that the 23% of the variation in DNA methylation is attributed chronological age, and that hypermethylation is more site-specific than hypomethylation. It appears that the change in DNA methylation partly overlap with regions that change histone modifications with age, indicating an interaction between the two major epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic modifications and change in gene expression over time most likely reflects the natural process of aging and variation between individuals might contribute to the development of age-related phenotypes and diseases such as type II diabetes, autoimmune and cardiovascular disease. © 2013 Johansson et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879537717

Of the 732 males of known age whose breeding we studied over 32 years (1980-2011) 13 (2%) were SY and 719 (98%) were ASY. During this period, the incidence of breeding of SY males changed markedly, as 12 of the instances of breeding of SY males were recorded in the first half of our study, only 1 in the latter half. We suggest that SY males could acquire nest sites more readily in the first half of the study when the breeding population of ASY males was apparently lower. Males breeding in their second year were on average similar in size to ASY males but were molting more extensively than were ASY males. ASY males lived longer than males breeding in their second year, and maximum lifetime production of young was greater, so SY males may have sacrificed greater longevity for breeding early. A strategy of facultative breeding in response to the constraints of higher numbers of older breeding males and restraints of trade-offs in energy allocation may explain why SY male Cooper's Hawks rarely breed. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2013.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878615820

I integrate individual-based multivariate phenotypic selection approaches with evolutionary demographic methods to demonstrate how a demographic transition in 19th century female populations of Utah altered relationships between fitness and age-specific survival and fertility. Coincident with this demographic transition, natural selection for fitness, as measured by the opportunity for selection, increased by 13% to 20% over 65 years. Proportional contributions of age-specific survival to total selection (the complement to age-specific fertility) diminished from approximately one third to one seventh following a marked increase in infant survival. Despite dramatic reductions in age-specific fertility variance at all ages, the absolute magnitude of selection for fitness explained by age-specific fertility increased by approximately 45%. I show that increases in the adaptive potential of fertility traits followed directly from decreased population growth rates.

In tropical Australian mangroves, Large-billed Gerygones Gerygone magnirostris typically build their pensile nests over tidal channels and often next to their old nests. We monitored the fate of nests of 28 pairs and used generalized linear models to investigate the importance of nest location to nesting success. Nest failure due to tidal flooding, but not predation, decreased significantly with nest height and distance from the tidal channel, suggesting that nesting over water does not always reduce nest predation, and, indeed, may incur costs through flooding. However, nest predation was significantly more likely at nests that were distant from old nests than those built close to old nests. Nest predators might give up searching for eggs or nestlings if nearby nests are empty (potential-prey-site hypothesis). Alternatively, gerygones may build near old intact nests because they signify 'safe' locations that have escaped nest predation in the past. © 2013 The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874979543

Braconids have been widely used to study the effects of temperature on host-parasitoid interactions and the present work focused on the solitary endoparasitoid Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae Aphidiidae), an efficient biological control agent commercially used against aphids such as the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae Thomas (Sternorrhyncha: Aphididae). Contrary to previous studies using heat shocks at extreme temperatures, we evaluated the effects of mild heat stresses by transferring young parasitoid adults from the constant temperature of 20°C to either a warm (25°C) or hot (28°C) temperature, for either 1 h or 48 h. Such treatments are consistent with situations commonly experienced by parasitoids when moved from their rearing conditions to greenhouses or field conditions. The effects were evaluated both on the heat stressed A. ervi adults (G0) (immediate effects) and on their first generation (G1) progeny (trans-generational effects). G0 wasps' mortality was significantly affected by the temperature in interaction with the duration of the stress. Longevity of G0 wasps surviving the heat stress was negatively affected by the temperature and females lived longer than males. Heat stress applied to A. ervi parents also had consequences on their G1 progeny whose developmental time, rates of mummification and percentage of parasitoid completing total development were negatively affected. Surprisingly, the egg load at emergence of the G1 female progeny was increased when their mothers had been submitted to a mild heat stress of 25°C or 28°C. These results clearly demonstrate trans-generational phenotypic plasticity, showing that adaptation to thermal stresses may be achieved via maternal effects. This study also sheds light on the complexity of insect responses and underlying mechanisms to fluctuating conditions in their natural environment. © 2013 Ismaeil et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873555040

Many children are born healthy, though fewer than is possible. Birthing and health rapidly improved generally due to modern housing, sanitation and medicine, as well as birth interventions. Arguably interventions have exceeded the optimal level, without enough regard for natural physical and intuitive resources. Conception, often too easy, receives too little personal preparation unless a couple has problems. Nurturing the health of sperm and ovum seems hard to focus on, yet is needed by both parents - and even by the four grandparents. What are the key factors? Positive: The fields of hormones/emotions and of nutrition/metabolism. Negative: stress, poor nutrition, toxins, diseases; much being due to poverty. Positive and negative both have structural and also epigenetic effects. Interventions, essential or inessential, are seldom without negative side effects. Health can best, and most economically, be generated at the beginning of life, through healthy conception, gestation and birth. Understanding prime needs improves initial health. It also informs therapy of any early-life problems. Healing is therefore more efficient when transgenerational, and much more powerful than individual healing. My vision of healing is safeguarding our evolution in progress. Children's choices - eating, exercise, emotional attitudes and relationships - are already profoundly affecting any children they may have, their mental and physical health. The most practical starting point seems to be educating boys as well as girls. Childhood is therefore the time to educate them in choices. The correction of often unnoticed problems- nutrient deficits, toxins, uro-genital disease - has enabled nearly nine out of ten couples to bear fully healthy babies, even following severe problems - infertility, miscarriages, stillbirths and malformations. Correcting problems before conception prevents both structural faults and wrong setting of gene-switches. Children's habits set. Once courting most are preoccupied and many pregnant unintentionally. Childhood is the time to be adopting a healthy lifestyle, the way to healthy babies The mother's nutritional and emotional status throughout pregnancy continues to affect her child's future physical and mental health, behaviour and ability. Before conception a woman needs to build her appropriate body stores - vitamins and minerals, proteins, docosahexaenoic acid. Before bearing another child, a replenishment time of 3 years is desirable. A return to childbearing in the 20s and early 30s could reduce risks that have risen with the recent shift towards conception by school children and by women in their late 30s or more. Governments, schoolteachers, health professionals, need to adopt this policy of transgenerational health. Empowerment with knowledge is the one way to fend off the growing pandemic of mental ill health and related disorders and to make the most of a nation's genetic potential. Financially there could be no better investment, let alone in enhancing people's lives. Childhood is the most appropriate time for education in this way to generating a healthy, able and peaceful human race. Essential to our amazing genetic systems are the resources of land, sea and air. We are one with our biosphere.

However, based on increasing evidence on the effects of maternal nutrient intake on offspring performance, this should be revised. In addition, the nutrition management of broiler breeder hens during lay is very controversial, and managers and nutritionists resort to the manipulation of feed allocation to improve egg production in these flocks. In this study, broiler breeder hens were fed diets differing in digestible lysine concentration from 26 to 60 wk of age. Fertile eggs were collected at 38, 48, and 60 wk and incubated. Broilers hatched were reared in commercial conditions and their performance was measured to 21 d of age. Based on this study, the feeding of the hens has a significant effect on offspring performance, and this should be considered when maternal requirements are investigated.

There is also increasing evidence for environmental effects on their demographic traits. However, quantifying how individuals differentially respond to environmental variations according to their age remains a challenge in ecology. In a population of Black-browed Albatrosses monitored during 43 years, we analyzed how lifehistory traits varied according to age, and whether individuals of different ages responded in different ways to environmental conditions. To do so, we: (1) examined how age affected seven life-history traits, (2) investigated differences in temporal variance of demographic traits between age classes, and (3) tested for age-dependent effects of climate and fisheries covariates on demographic traits. Overall, there was a tendency for traits to improve during the first years of life (5-10 years), to peak and remain stable at middle age (10-30 years), and decline at old ages. At young ages, survival and reproductive parameters increased, except offspring body condition at fledging, suggesting that younger parents had already acquired good foraging capacities. However, they suffered from inexperience in breeding as suggested by their higher breeding failures during incubation. There was evidence for reproductive and actuarial senescence. In particular, breeding success and offspring body condition declined abruptly, suggesting altered foraging capacities of old individuals. Middle-aged individuals had the lowest temporal variance of demographic traits. Although this is predicted by the theory of environmental canalization, it could also results from a higher susceptibility of young and old birds due to their respective inexperience and senescence. The highest temporal variances were found in old individuals. Survival was significantly influenced by sea surface temperatures in the foraging zone of this albatross population during breeding. During warm events survival of young and old individuals improved, whereas a decrease was observed for middle-aged individuals. Presumably, during cold years with poor environmental conditions, young and old breeding birds may suffer more from intraspecific competition for resources than middleaged individuals. This study showed that age, known as a major factor structuring demography in long-lived species, can also potentially influence the response of populations to global change. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876143863

Design: A mixed model was used to analyze the cross-sequential data that include cross-sectional and longitudinal elements. The data were collected in 1993, 1998, 2003, and 2008. Setting: Data were collected at 2 Midwestern hospitals and a Southeastern specialty hospital in the United States. Participants: Adult participants (N=1032) with SCI of at least 1-year duration who participated during at least 1 of 4 times of measurement dating back to 1993. Of these, 463 participated on all 4 occasions. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The outcome measures were 3 indicators of medical treatments - hospitalization, days hospitalized, and nonroutine physician visits. A fourth outcome was self-reported fitness. Results: Results of the growth model indicated some limited cohort effects for chronologic age, years since injury, and age at injury onset at baseline. However, significant time effects were observed for each of the health indices, with hospitalizations and physician visits increasing and self-reported fitness decreasing. Significant cohort by time interactions were observed for both number of hospitalizations and days hospitalized with years postinjury and chronologic age. Conclusions: The natural course of change in the health indices was in the direction of a greater need for treatment and reduced fitness over time.

In humans, telomere length shortening is considered to be one critical factor in cellular senescence and organ survival. In this study, we compared basal and stimulated gastric acid and duodenal HCO3- secretory rates in aged late-generation (G3) telomerase-deficient (mTERC-/-) mice, which are characterized by severe telomere dysfunction due to the inability to elongate telomeres during cell division. We found that basal and forskolin-stimulated HCO3- secretion and short-circuit current (Isc) in isolated duodenal mucosa of G3 mTERC-/- mice were markedly reduced compared with age-matched wild-type mice. In contrast, basal and forskolin-stimulated acid secretory rates in isolated G3 mTERC-/- gastric mucosa were not significantly altered. Correspondingly, duodenal mucosa of G3 mTERC-/- mice showed slimming and shortening of villi, whereas gastric mucosal histology was not significantly altered. However, the ratios of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and solute-linked carrier 26 gene family (Slc26a6) mRNA expression in relation to cytokeratin-18 were not altered in duodenal mucosa. The further knockout of p21, which is a downstream effector of telomere shortening-induced senescence, rescued villus atrophy of duodenal mucosa, and basal and forskolin-stimulated duodenal HCO3- secretion and Isc in mTERC-/- p21-/- double-knockout mice were not different from wild-type controls. In conclusion, genetic ablation of telomerase resulted in p21-dependent duodenal mucosal atrophy and reduced duodenal HCO3- secretory capacity, whereas gastric morphology and acid secretory function were preserved. This suggests that telomere shortening during aging may result in an imbalance between aggressive and protective secretions against duodenal mucosa and thus predispose to ulcer formation. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871329159

Methods: Parents took part in a cardiorespiratory disease survey in two Scottish towns during the 1970s, in which their physical stature was measured. In 1996, their offspring were invited to participate in a similar survey, which included an electrocardiogram recording and risk factor assessment. Results: A total of 2306 natural offspring aged 30-59 years from 1456 couples were subsequently flagged for notification of mortality and followed for CHD-related hospitalizations. Taller paternal and/or maternal height was associated with socio-economic advantage, heavier birthweight and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in offspring. Increased height in fathers, but more strongly in mothers (risk ratio for 1 SD change in maternal height = 0.85; 95% confidence interval: 0.76 to 0.95), was associated with a lower risk of offspring CHD, adjusting for age, sex, other parental height and CHD risk factors.

We investigated the properties of stumps that promoted the natural regeneration of coniferous species in a natural old-growth forest dominated by Cryptomeria japonica (L.f.) D. Don. A comparison of C. japonica saplings growing in three microsites (ground, stumps, and fallen logs) revealed that sapling density was highest on the stumps; 75% of saplings were distributed on stumps, which occupied only 3% of the projected forest area. The mortality of saplings during the 3-year study period did not differ significantly among the three microsites. Six properties of stumps were quantified: height, diameter at ground level, decay class, species taxon, type (i.e., cause of occurrence: logging or natural disturbance), and light conditions. Of these properties, the type of stump was the most influential. The density of saplings was significantly greater on stumps produced by logging than on naturally broken stumps. Taller stumps exhibited a significantly higher density of saplings; indeed, there were no saplings on stumps less than 60 cm in height. Saplings on stumps were concentrated in higher positions on the stump, and survivorship tended to be greater when their root location was higher. We concluded that the height of the microsite was an important factor for regeneration of C. japonica at this research site, where saplings were under competition with dense undergrowth vegetation.

Related species, populations, and individuals within populations show genetically based variation in life span and other aspects of age-related performance. Population differences are especially informative because these differences can be large relative to within-population variation and because they occur in organisms with otherwise similar genomes. We used experimental evolution to produce populations divergent for life span and late-age fertility and then used deep genome sequencing to detect sequence variants with nucleotide-level resolution. Several genes and genome regions showed strong signatures of selection, and the same regions were implicated in independent comparisons, suggesting that the same alleles were selected in replicate lines. Genes related to oogenesis, immunity, and protein degradation were implicated as important modifiers of late-life performance. Expression profiling and functional annotation narrowed the list of strong candidate genes to 38, most of which are novel candidates for regulating aging. Life span and early age fecundity were negatively correlated among populations; therefore, the alleles we identified also are candidate regulators of a major life-history trade-off.

We found differences in ageing patterns between populations. Generally, young (i.e. yearling) and old females (i.e. ≥ 5 years of age) laid their first eggs later and produced smaller clutches than middle-aged females (i.e. 2-4 years of age) in both populations. The southernmost population (i.e. Spanish) showing the shorter migratory distance experienced a greater within-individual increase in timing of breeding and clutch size in early life and a greater within-individual decrease in laying date but not in clutch size during senescence compared with the northernmost population (i.e. Danish). We also found that the number of fledglings produced annually was related to the age of the two members of the breeding pairs with pairs composed of young and old females performing less well than breeding pairs composed of middle-aged females. We did not find reproductive senescence for the age of the male while controlling for the age of the female on the number of fledglings produced annually by the breeding pair. Differential survival between individuals did not explain age effects on laying date or annual clutch size in neither population. However, the increase in the number of fledglings produced annually with age was partly explained by the disappearance of poor-quality members of the pairs, mainly poor-quality males. Age-related breeding success (i.e. number of fledglings) was similar for barn swallows from Spain and Denmark.

Here, it is argued that cellular life involves (i) inevitable accumulation of damage resulting from imperfectness and heterogeneity of every cellular process, and (ii) dilution of damage when cells divide. While severe damage is cleared by protective systems, milder damage can only be diluted. This is due to the high cost of accuracy, the greater number of damage forms compared to protective systems, and the constraints on cellular life inherited from the prokaryotic world. This strategy also applies to cancer cells, which are particularly dependent on damage dilution. Imposing restriction on cell division necessarily leads to aging. Interventions that extend lifespan act through metabolic reprogramming, thereby changing both damage composition and the rate of damage accumulation. Thus, heterogeneity leading to myriad mild damage forms represents the cause of aging, whereas the processes that affect the damage landscape and damage accumulation are lifespan regulators. © 2012 WILEY Periodicals, Inc..",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867435039

These transgenerational effects challenge conventional understanding about the modes and mechanisms of inheritance, but their molecular basis is poorly understood. The Deadend1 (Dnd1) gene enhances susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) in mice, in part by interacting epigenetically with other TGCT modifier genes in previous generations. Sequence homology to A1cf, the RNA-binding subunit of the ApoB editing complex, raises the possibility that the function of Dnd1 is related to Apobec1 activity as a cytidine deaminase. We conducted a series of experiments with a genetically engineered deficiency of Apobec1 on the TGCT-susceptible 129/Sv inbred background to determine whether dosage of Apobec1 modifies susceptibility, either alone or in combination with Dnd1, and either in a conventional or a transgenerational manner. In the paternal germ-lineage, Apobec1 deficiency significantly increased susceptibility among heterozygous but not wild-type male offspring, without subsequent transgenerational effects, showing that increased TGCT risk resulting from partial loss of Apobec1 function is inherited in a conventional manner. By contrast, partial deficiency in the maternal germ-lineage led to suppression of TGCTs in both partially and fully deficient males and significantly reduced TGCT risk in a transgenerational manner among wild-type offspring. These heritable epigenetic changes persisted for multiple generations and were fully reversed after consecutive crosses through the alternative germ-lineage. These results suggest that Apobec1 plays a central role in controlling TGCT susceptibility in both a conventional and a transgenerational manner.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867341997

This study evaluates the effects of ovarian hyperstimulation, the in vitro procedure and time to pregnancy (TTP) - as proxy for the severity of subfertility - on the prevalence of dysmorphic features. Design/methods: Participants were singletons born following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation-IVF/ICSI (COH-IVF/ICSI; n = 66), or modified natural cycle-IVF/ICSI (MNC-IVF/ICSI; n = 56), or to subfertile couples who conceived naturally (Sub-NC; n = 86). Dysmorphic features were assessed according to the method of Merks et al., and are classified into 'minor variants' (minor anomalies or common variants) and 'abnormalities' (clinically relevant or irrelevant abnormalities). We focussed on minor anomalies as they indicate altered embryonic development and because they have the advantage of a higher prevalence. Results: The prevalences of any of the outcome measures were similar in the three groups. One or more minor anomalies, our primary outcome measure, occurred in 50% of COH-IVF/ICSI, 54% of MNC-IVF/ICSI and 53% of Sub-NC children. TTP in years was significantly associated with abnormalities (adjustedOR = 1.20; 95%CI = 1.02-1.40), especially with clinically relevant abnormalities (adjustedOR = 1.22; 95%CI = 1.01-1.48). Conclusions: The study indicates that ovarian hyperstimulation and the in vitro procedure are not associated with an increase in dysmorphic features. The positive association between TTP and clinically relevant abnormalities suggests a role of the underlying subfertility and its determinants in the genesis of dysmorphic features. © 2012.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865555573

We also demonstrated that longevity in chronologically aging yeast is programmed by the level of metabolic capacity and organelle organization that they developed before entering a quiescent state and, thus, that chronological aging in yeast is likely to be the final step of a developmental program progressing through at least one checkpoint prior to entry into quiescence. Here, we investigate how LCA influences longevity and several longevity-defining cellular processes in chronologically aging yeast if added to growth medium at different periods of the lifespan. We found that LCA can extend longevity of yeast under CR (caloric restriction) conditions only if added at either of two lifespan periods. One of them includes logarithmic and diauxic growth phases, whereas the other period exists in early stationary phase. Our findings suggest a mechanism linking the ability of LCA to increase the lifespan of CR yeast only if added at either of the two periods to its differential effects on various longevity-defining processes. In this mechanism, LCA controls these processes at three checkpoints that exist in logarithmic/diauxic, post-diauxic and early stationary phases. We therefore hypothesize that a biomolecular longevity network progresses through a series of checkpoints, at each of which (1) genetic, dietary and pharmacological anti-aging interventions modulate a distinct set of longevity-defining processes comprising the network, and (2) checkpoint-specific master regulators monitor and govern the functional states of these processes. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866773226

Currently, physical exercise is considered a cardioprotective strategy and more research is needed on its benefit on cardiac autonomic function. Objective: To evaluate the autonomic control of heart rate in healthy young and middle-aged volunteers with different levels of aerobic fitness. Methods: The study included 68 volunteers, stratified for age and level of aerobic fitness. Based on aerobic fitness assessed by the submaximal exercise test, subjects were separated into two groups, good fitness and poor fitness. Assessment of cardiac autonomic control was performed based on measurements of heart rate variability at rest and heart rate recovery post-exercise. Analysis of variance with two factors was used to compare the variables investigated. Results: The heart rate variability is significantly lower in middle-aged volunteers than in young individuals, regardless of the aerobic fitness level (p <0.01). Higher levels of aerobic fitness in middle-aged volunteers are associated with earlier post-effort vagal reentry - rate of HR decline after 1min30s: 39.6% good aerobic fitness vs. poor 28.4% (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Better levels of aerobic fitness act beneficially on the autonomic control of post-exercise heart rate, preserving the vagal reentry velocity in healthy middle-aged volunteers.

Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are major contributors to late graft loss; features of tubular cell senescence, such as increased p16INK4a expression, associate with these tubulointerstitial changes, but it is unknown whether the relationship is causal. Here, loss of the INK4a locus in mice, which allows escape from p16 INK4a-dependent senescence, significantly reduced interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and associated with improved renal function, conservation of nephron mass, and transplant survival. Compared with wild-type controls, kidneys from INK4a-/- mice developed significantly less interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Consistently, mice that received kidney transplants from INK4a/ARF-/- donors had significantly better survival 21 days after life-supporting kidney transplantation and developed less tubulointerstitial changes. This correlated with higher proliferative rates of tubular cells and significantly fewer senescent cells. Taken together, these data suggest a pathogenic role of renal cellular senescence in the development of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and kidney graft deterioration by preventing the recovery from injury. Inhibiting premature senescence could have therapeutic benefit in kidney transplantation but has to be balanced against the risks of suspending antitumor defenses.

In contrast, skeletal muscle exhibited significant telomere shortening in exercise mice compared with sedentary and young mice. Telomerase enzyme activity was increased in skeletal muscle of exercise compared with sedentary animals but was similar in cardiac and liver tissues. We observed significant age-related decreases in expression of telomere-related genes that were attenuated by exercise in cardiac and skeletal muscle but not liver.

Acoustic ornaments are often used as secondary sexual traits that signal the quality of the signaller. Here we show that song performance reflects age and reproductive success in the rock sparrow (Petronia petronia). In an Alpine population in south-east France, we recorded the songs of males and assessed their genetic breeding success by microsatellite analysis. In addition to temporal and spectral song features, we also analysed for the first time whether the sound pressure level of bird song reflects reproductive success. Males with higher breeding success sang at a lower rate and with a higher maximum frequency. We found also that older males gained more extra-pair young and had a higher overall breeding success, although they also differed almost significantly by having a higher loss of paternity in their own nests. Older males could be distinguished from yearlings by singing at lower rate and higher amplitudes. Our findings suggest that song rate may be used as a signal of age and together with song pitch as a signal of reproductive success in this species. Alternatively, younger and less successful males might try to compensate their inferior status by increased song rates and lower pitch. Independent of age and quality, high-amplitude songs correlated with paternity loss in the own nest, suggesting that in this species song amplitude is not an indicator of male quality but high-intensity songs may be rather a response to unfaithful social mates. © 2012 Nemeth et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865294315

Yet despite its exploitation and importance in many artisanal fisheries throughout the world, little is known about its life history, ecology and vulnerability. We used stylet increment analysis to age a wild O. cyanea population for the first time and gonad histology to examine their reproductive characteristics. O. cyanea conforms to many cephalopod life history generalisations having rapid, non-asymptotic growth, a short life-span and high levels of mortality. Males were found to mature at much younger ages and sizes than females with reproductive activity concentrated in the spring and summer months. The female dominated sex-ratios in association with female brooding behaviours also suggest that larger conspicuous females may be more prone to capture and suggests that this intertidal octopus population has the potential to be negatively impacted in an unregulated fishery. Size at age and maturity comparisons between our temperate bordering population and lower latitude Tanzanian and Hawaiian populations indicated stark differences in growth rates that correlate with water temperatures. The variability in life history traits between global populations suggests that management of O. cyanea populations should be tailored to each unique set of life history characteristics and that stylet increment analysis may provide the integrity needed to accurately assess this. © 2012 Herwig et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865083893

We have employed a transcriptionally inducible telomere to investigate how telomere transcription affects telomere function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We report that telomere shortening resulting from high levels of telomere transcription stems from a DNA replication-dependent loss of telomere tracts, which can occur independent of both telomerase inhibition and homologous recombination. We show that in order for telomere loss to occur, transcription must pass through the telomere tract itself producing a TERRA molecule. We demonstrate that increased telomere transcription of a single telomere leads to a premature cellular senescence in the absence of a telomere maintenance mechanism (telomerase and homology directed repair). Similar rapid senescence and telomere shortening are also seen in sir2Δ cells with compromised telomere maintenance, where TERRA levels are increased at natural telomeres.

However, the links between telomere length and key history traits such as reproductive performances have received little attention and remain unclear to date. The leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea is a long-lived species showing rapid growth at early stages of life, one of the highest reproductive outputs observed in vertebrates and a dichotomised reproductive pattern related to migrations lasting 2 or 3 years, supposedly associated with different environmental conditions. Here we tested the prediction of blood telomere shortening with age in this species and investigated the relationship between blood telomere length and reproductive performances in leatherback turtles nesting in French Guiana. We found that blood telomere length did not differ between hatchlings and adults. The absence of blood telomere shortening with age may be related to an early high telomerase activity. This telomere-restoring enzyme was formerly suggested to be involved in preventing early telomere attrition in early fast-growing and long-lived species, including squamate reptiles. We found that within one nesting cycle, adult females having performed shorter migrations prior to the considered nesting season had shorter blood telomeres and lower reproductive output. We propose that shorter blood telomeres may result from higher oxidative stress in individuals breeding more frequently (i.e., higher costs of reproduction) and/or restoring more quickly their body reserves in cooler feeding areas during preceding migration (i.e., higher foraging costs). This first study on telomeres in the giant leatherback turtle suggests that blood telomere length predicts not only survival chances, but also reproductive performances. Telomeres may therefore be a promising new tool to evaluate individual reproductive quality which could be useful in such species of conservation concern. © 2012 Plot et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863770775

The channel consists of two subunits, α and β. The α-subunit can function in isolation as an ion channel, and the β-subunit modulates channel activity and has a structural role. We previously reported that a mouse knockout (KO) of the β-subunit and related glutamic acid rich proteins (GARPs) attenuates rod function and causes structural alterations and slowly progressive retinal degeneration. Here, we have extended our functional analyses of the KO mice evaluating rod and cone function using the electroretinogram in mice up to 4 months of age. Retinal stratification is preserved in the knockout mice at 3 months, and a significant number of cones remain up to 7 months based on PNA staining of cone sheaths. Electroretinography of KO mice at 1 month old revealed a diminished darkadapted b-wave and normal light-adapted b-wave compared to wild-type mice. Over the next 3 months, both dark- and light-adapted b-wave amplitudes declined, but the reduction was greater for darkadapted b-wave amplitudes. In one-month-old mice, the critical flicker frequency (CFF) was substantially lower for the KO mice at scotopic intensities, but normal at photopic intensities. CFF values remained stable in the KO mice as the b-wave amplitudes decreased with age. Declining b-wave amplitudes confirm an RP phenotype of rod followed by cone degeneration.

Here we report that strains with lower IGF1 have significantly delayed age of female sexual maturation, measured by vaginal patency (VP). Among strains with normal lifespans (mean lifespan &gt;600 d), delayed age of VP associated with greater longevity (P = 0.015), suggesting a genetically regulated tradeoff at least partly mediated by IGF1. Supporting this hypothesis, C57BL/6J females had 9% lower IGF1, 6% delayed age of VP, and 24% extended lifespan compared with C57BL/6J.C3H/HeJ-Igf1, which carries a C3H/HeJ allele on chromosome (Chr) 10 that increases IGF1. To identify genetic loci/genes that regulate female sexual maturation, including loci that mediate lifespan tradeoffs, we performed haplotype association mapping for age of VP and identified significant loci on Chrs 4 (Vpq1) and 16 (Vpq2 and 3). At each locus, wild-derived strains share a unique haplotype that associates with delayed VP. Substitution of Chr 16 of C57BL/6J with Chr 16 from a wild-derived strain significantly reduced IGF1 and delayed VP. Strains with a wild-derived allele at Vpq3 have significantly extended longevity compared with strains with other alleles. Bioinformatic analysis identified Nrip1 at Vpq3 as a candidate gene. Nrip1-/- females have significantly reduced IGF1 and delayed age of VP compared with Nrip1+/+ females.

Nevertheless, these results are from observations of free-living individuals and therefore, it remains impossible to determine whether these variations result from parental investment or efficiency or both, and whether these variations occur during the prenatal or the postnatal stage or during both. Our study aimed first, to determine whether age had an impact on the expression of maternal breeding care by comparing inexperienced female birds of two different ages, and second, to define how these potential differences impact chicks' growth and behavioural development. We made 22 2-month-old and 22 8-month-old female Japanese quail foster 1-day-old chicks. We observed their maternal behaviour until the chicks were 11 days old and then tested these chicks after separation from their mothers. Several behavioural tests estimated their fearfulness and their sociality. We observed first that a longer induction was required for young females to express maternal behaviour. Subsequently as many young females as elder females expressed maternal behaviour, but young females warmed chicks less, expressed less covering postures and rejected their chicks more. Chicks brooded by elder females presented higher growth rates and more fearfulness and sociality. Our results reveal that maternal investment increased with age independently of maternal experience, suggesting modification of hormone levels implied in maternal behaviour. Isolated effects of maternal experience should now be assessed in females of the same age. In addition, our results show, for first time in birds, that variations in maternal care directly induce important differences in the behavioural development of chicks. Finally, our results confirm that Japanese quail remains a great laboratory model of avian maternal behaviour and that the way we sample maternal behaviour is highly productive. © 2012 Pittet et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860999204

Previous studies have shown that p16Ink4a plays an important role in the response to DNA damage signals caused by telomere dysfunction. In this study, we crossed Wrn-/- and p16Ink4a-/- mice to knock out the p16Ink4a function in a Wrn null background. Growth curves showed that loss of p16Ink4a could rescue the growth barriers that are observed in Wrn-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). By challenging the MEFs with the global genotoxin doxorubicin, we showed that loss of p16Ink4a did not dramatically affect the global DNA damage response of Wrn-/- MEFs induced by doxorubicin. However, in response to telomere dysfunction initiated by the telomere damaging protein TRF2ΔBΔM, loss of p16Ink4a could partially overcome the DNA damage response by disabling p16Ink4a up-regulation and reducing the accumulation of γ-H2AX that is observed in Wrn-/- MEFs. Furthermore, in response to TRF2ΔBΔM overexpression, Wrn-/- MEFs senesced within several passages. In contrast, p16Ink4a-/- and p16Ink4a-/-Wrn-/- MEFs could continuously grow and lose expression of the exogenous TRF2ΔBΔM in their late passages. In summary, our data suggest that in the context of telomere dysfunction, loss of p16Ink4a function could prevent cells from senescence.

In this study, we compare life history traits between Palaeolithic and present-day vertebrates, analysing the number of winters spent in the river and at sea by North Iberian salmonids (Salmo salar and Salmo trutta) from two separate time frames: the Upper Palaeolithic, based on archaeological remains, and the present day, based on sport catches. The river stage did not change significantly, but the marine period has been shortened in modern anadromous specimens, accordingly shortening mean generation time. Population growth rates have been estimated through Bayesian analyses of the mitochondrial DNA control region of modern specimens for the two Salmo species using two different mutation rates (1% and 3.6%). Coincidence of coalescent N e estimates with independent N e calculated from catches suggests that the 3.6% mutation rate fits better the evolution of the studied populations.

Inlong-lived vertebrates, reproductive output usually increases during early adulthood, but it is difficult to disentangle the roles of development and learning on this gain of reproductive success. Lekking lance-tailed manakins provide an opportunity to separate these processes, as the vast majority of male reproduction occurs after a bird obtains alpha status and maintains a display area in the lek, but the age at which males achieve alpha status varies widely. Using 11 years of longitudinal data on age, social status and genetic siring success, I assessed the factors influencing variation in siring success by individuals over their lifetimes. The data show increases in annual reproductive success with both age and alpha experience. At advanced ages, these gains were offset by senescence in fecundity. Individual ontogeny, rather than compositional change of the population, generated a nonlinear relationship of breeding tenure with lifetime success; age of assuming alpha status was unrelated to tenure as a breeder, or success in the alpha role.

We further characterized two of these genes, the highly homologous SET domain containing genes, set-9 and set-26. They share redundant functions in maintaining normal lifespan, while exhibiting differential tissue expression patterns. Furthermore, we found that set-9 and set-26 partially act through the Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor, DAF-16, to modulate lifespan.

Plasma antioxidant defences, oxidative damage levels and telomere length were measured at the beginning and at the end of the post-winter growth period in three groups of chicks (small chicks, which either passed away or survived the growth period, and large chicks). Small chicks that died early during the growth period had the highest level of oxidative damage and the shortest telomere lengths prior to death.

Theory predicts that parents should adjust their nest defence according to the value of the brood at stake, defending more intensively broods with high survival and reproductive prospects. We evaluated the influence of offspring number, offspring age, laying date and parent sex on nest-defence intensity (NDI) of the Imperial Shag Phalacrocorax atriceps, a sexually dimorphic seabird with seasonal decline in offspring survival and very limited renesting potential. We also evaluated whether NDI was correlated within pairs and whether NDI of both members of the pair was correlated with incubation and breeding success. To elicit defensive behaviour, we simulated predation attempts using a Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus model. As predicted by theory, NDI was positively correlated with the number of offspring in the nest and offspring age. NDI during chick rearing was higher than that at early and late incubation, while no differences were found between incubation stages. Contrary to our prediction, we did not find differences in NDI according to laying date. NDI for males was higher than females, while NDI was also positively correlated within pairs. NDI was not statistically related to incubation or breeding success. These results suggest that other factors, such as laying date or parental quality and age, play a much larger role in determining the outcome and productivity of a nesting attempt.

Here, we investigated prenatal influence of parent age on yolk steroid levels and on offspring phenotype. We compared Japanese quail at two different ages: at the beginning of their reproductive cycle (11. weeks old: age 1) and six months later, after egg production peak (37. weeks old: age 2). Egg composition, reproductive outcomes, and offspring growth, sexual development and behaviour were studied at both ages. We found that laying rate, fertility and chick survival rates declined between age 1 and age 2. Age 2 eggs had relatively lighter shells and higher yolk plus albumen contents; they also had lower testosterone contents. Age 2 offspring weighed more at hatching than did age 1 offspring; subsequently their growth patterns differed and their sexual development was more precocious. Age 2 offspring were less emotional than age 1 offspring when encountering a novel environment, and they appeared more sensitive to social separation.

Few investigators have examined time-specific patterns of nest survival in Neotropical birds, and most such studies have focused on tropical and subtropical species. To better understand age-related patterns of nest survival, we studied nest survival of Red-crested Cardinals (Paroaria coronata, Thraupidae) in a south-temperate forest in Argentina. We modeled daily nest survival rates (DSR) using program MARK. We examined the relationship between nest age and nest survival rate, controlling for the effects of physical characteristics of nest sites and progression of the breeding season. We monitored 367 nests for a total of 4018 exposure days. We found that DSR increased with nest age and was higher in small isolated patches than in large continuous patches of forests. The increase of DSR with nest age could be a consequence of more vulnerable nests being predated early in the nesting cycle or a result of parents defending nests more vigorously as nestlings age because of their increasing reproductive value. Open areas of grassland that surrounded the small isolated patches of forests in our study may have been a barrier to predator movements, possibly explaining the lower predation rates. Nest survival rates in our study were lower than those reported for tropical or Nearctic temperate birds, but similar to those reported in other studies of Neotropical temperate birds. Reasons for the low nest survival rates of Neotropical temperate birds remain unclear, and additional studies of predator communities are needed to help elucidate this topic. © 2012 The Authors.

This pattern of inheritance may be due to the fact that germ cells produced by terminal differentiation and to the absence of appreciable epigenetic reprogramming during the life cycle. Recent advances in mass sequencing technology have accelerated the decoding of the epigenomes of various tissues and cell types and provided new insights into the dynamics of epigenetic changes during the plant life cycle and in response to environmental challenges.

Birds with multiple broods within a season can disperse not only between, but also within, years. Little is known about factors that govern dispersal within a season or how strong it is compared with dispersal between years. We studied breeding dispersal of Eurasian Hoopoes (Upupa epops) in Valais, Switzerland, using capture-recapture data collected over 8 years (n = 712 individuals). We analyzed breeding dispersal probability and distance, both between and within years, in relation to age, sex, and reproductive output, using multistate capture-recapture models and generalized linear models. Between years, females dispersed more often and over longer distances than males (mean distance, females = 1.98 km; males = 0.83 km), but dispersal was only weakly affected by age and previous reproductive success. Dispersal within a year also differed between sexes (mean distance, females = 1.45 km; males = 0.46 km) and varied little with age or previous reproductive success. Dispersal probability within years was lower and occurred over shorter distances than dispersal between years. Thus, dispersal decisions did not seem to depend on different cues, although dispersal within the breeding season might be constrained by habitat saturation. Breeding dispersal was common in Hoopoes, compared with other bird species. Together with the fact that immigration is an important component of this species' population dynamics, such dispersal patterns suggest that successful conservation of Eurasian Hoopoes requires extended breeding grounds to maintain sustainable populations. © 2012 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

Molluscs, including oysters and abalone, are the basis of important fisheries globally and have been problematic to accurately age. To determine whether telomere length could provide an alternative means of ageing molluscs, we evaluated the relationship between telomere length and age using the commercially important Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata). Telomere lengths were estimated from tissues of known age individuals from different age classes, locations and at different sampling times. Telomere length tended to decrease with age only in young oysters less than 18 months old, but no decrease was observed in older oysters aged 2-4 years. Regional and temporal differences in telomere attrition rates were also observed. The relationship between telomere length and age was weak, however, with individuals of identical age varying significantly in their telomere length making it an imprecise age biomarker in oysters. © 2011 Her Majesty the Queen in Rights of Australia.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855203177

Since sex steroids are neuroprotective, their decrease with age may underlie age-related neuronal degeneration. To test this, we examined Purkinje cell numbers, plasma sex steroids and cerebellar neurosteroid concentrations during normal ageing (wild-type mice, WT), in our model of precocious ageing (Rora +/sg, heterozygous staggerer mice in which expression of the neuroprotective factor RORα is disrupted) and after long-term hormone insufficiency (WT post-gonadectomy). During normal ageing (WT), circulating sex steroids declined prior to or in parallel with Purkinje cell loss, which began at 18 months of age. Although Purkinje cell death was advanced in WT long-term steroid deficiency, this premature neuronal loss did not begin until 9 months, indicating that vulnerability to sex steroid deficiency is a phenomenon of ageing Purkinje neurons. In precocious ageing (Rora +/sg ), circulating sex steroids decreased prematurely, in conjunction with marked Purkinje cell death from 9 months. Although Rora +/sg Purkinje cells are vulnerable through their RORα haplo-insufficiency, it is only as they age (after 9 months) that sex steroid failure becomes critical. Finally, cerebellar neurosteroids did not decrease with age in either genotype or gender; but were profoundly reduced by 3 months in male Rora +/sg cerebella, which may contribute to the fragility of their Purkinje neurons. These data suggest that ageing Purkinje cells are maintained by circulating sex steroids, rather than local neurosteroids, and that in Rora +/sg their age-related death is advanced by premature sex steroid loss induced by RORα haplo-insufficiency. © 2011 The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-80755163539

However, in the wild, little is known about effects of parental senescence on offspring quality. We used data from a 21-year study to examine the role of parental age on offspring probability of recruitment in a long-lived bird, the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). Offspring probability of recruiting into the breeding population varied over the life of parents and effects age were similar in mothers and fathers. Offspring recruitment was high when parents were roughly 6-12 years old and low before and after then. Effects of parental age on offspring recruitment varied with lifespan (parental age at last reproduction) and previous breeding experience. Offspring recruitment from young and old parents with long reproductive lifespans was greater than that of offspring from parents with short lifespans at young and old ages. For parents with little previous breeding experience recruitment of offspring decreased with their hatch date, but experienced parents were no similarly affected. We found evidence of terminal effects on offspring recruitment in young parents but not in older parents, suggesting that senescence is more likely a gradual process of deterioration than a process of terminal illness. Failure to recruit probably reflects mortality during the first years after independence but also during the fledgling transition to full independence. Our results show effects of parental age and quality on offspring viability in a long-lived wild vertebrate and support the idea that wild populations are composed of individuals of different quality, and that this individual heterogeneity can influence the dynamics of age-structured populations. © 2011 Torres et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-80555139965

Mitochondria that are retained in mother cells during yeast cell division have a significantly more oxidizing redox potential and higher superoxide levels compared to mitochondria in buds. Retention of mitochondria with more oxidizing redox potential in mother cells occurs to the same extent in young and older cells and can account for the age-associated decline in total cellular mitochondrial redox potential in yeast as they age from 0 to 5 generations. Deletion of Mmr1p, a member of the DSL1 family of tethering proteins that localizes to mitochondria at the bud tip and is required for normal mitochondrial inheritance, produces defects in mitochondrial quality control and heterogeneity in replicative lifespan (RLS). Long-lived mmr1Δ cells exhibit prolonged RLS, reduced mean generation times, more reducing mitochondrial redox potential and lower mitochondrial superoxide levels compared to wild-type cells. Short-lived mmr1Δ cells exhibit the opposite phenotypes. Moreover, short-lived cells give rise exclusively to short-lived cells, while the majority of daughters of long-lived cells are long lived.

In species with longer life expectancies, newly born cells in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation are less abundant or can be completely absent. Several lines of evidence indicate that the regulatory mechanisms of adult neurogenesis differ between short- and long-lived mammals. After a critical appraisal of the factors and problems associated with comparing different species, we provide a quantitative comparison derived from seven laboratory strains of mice (BALB, C57BL/6, CD1, outbred) and rats (F344, Sprague-Dawley, Wistar), six other rodent species of which four are wild-derived (wood mouse, vole, spiny mouse and guinea pig), three non-human primate species (marmoset and two macaque species) and one carnivore (red fox). Normalizing the number of proliferating cells to total granule cell number, we observe an overall exponential decline in proliferation that is chronologically equal between species and orders and independent of early developmental processes and life span. Long- and short-lived mammals differ with regard to major life history stages; at the time points of weaning, age at first reproduction and average life expectancy, long-lived primates and foxes have significantly fewer proliferating cells than rodents. Although the database for neuronal differentiation is limited, we find indications that the extent of neuronal differentiation is subject to species-specific selective adaptations. We conclude that absolute age is the critical factor regulating cell genesis in the adult hippocampus of mammals.

However, such factors have rarely been investigated together, and it remains largely unknown whether they interact to affect age-specific performance. We used 27years of longitudinal data collected on tawny owls with estimates of prey density (field voles) from Kielder Forest (UK) to investigate how prey density at birth affects ageing patterns in reproduction and survival. Natal conditions experienced by tawny owls, measured in terms of vole density, dramatically varied among cohorts and explained 87% of the deviance in first-year apparent survival (annual estimates ranging from 0·07 to 0·33). We found evidence for senescence in survival for females as well as for males. Model-averaged estimates showed that adult survival probability declined linearly with age for females from age1. In contrast, male survival probability, lower on average than for female, declined after a plateau at age1-3. We also found evidence for reproductive senescence (number of offspring). For females, reproductive performance increased until age9 then declined. Males showed an earlier decline in reproductive performance with an onset of senescence at age3. Long-lasting effects of natal environmental conditions were sex specific. Female reproductive performance was substantially related to natal conditions (difference of 0·24 fledgling per breeding event between females born in the first or third quartile of vole density), whereas male performance was not. We found no evidence for tawny owls born in years with low prey density having accelerated rates of senescence.

We compared habitat configuration and composition at four spatial scales (0.14, 0.5, 1 and 2 km) around 54 nests and related daily nest survival rate to the distance to the nearest forest edge, mean patch size of late-seral forest (r = 141 m), proportion of non-forested lands (r = 141 m), density of maintained roads (r = 1 km), proportion of cone-producing spruce plantations (r = 2 km), and year. The best model included distance to the nearest edge and proportion of cone-producing plantations. Distance of nests to the nearest edge was the best individual predictor of daily nest survival. A larger sample of nests showed a significant threshold in distance to the nearest forest edge; nests located at least 100 m away were more likely to fledge young. These results suggest that even in managed forest landscapes, matrix effects can be important and some bird species may exhibit negative edge effects. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80955178874

In order to gain insight into aging as a polygenic trait, we employed an outbred Saccharomyces cerevisiae model, generated by crossing a vineyard strain RM11 and a laboratory strain S288c, to identify quantitative trait loci that control chronological lifespan. Among the major loci that regulate chronological lifespan in this cross, one genetic linkage was found to be congruent with a previously mapped locus that controls telomere length variation. We found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in BUL2, encoding a component of an ubiquitin ligase complex involved in trafficking of amino acid permeases, controls chronological lifespan and telomere length as well as amino acid uptake. Cellular amino acid availability changes conferred by the BUL2 polymorphism alter telomere length by modulating activity of a transcription factor Gln3. Among the GLN3 transcriptional targets relevant to this phenotype, we identified Wtm1, whose upregulation promotes nuclear retention of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) components and inhibits the assembly of the RNR enzyme complex during S-phase. Inhibition of RNR is one of the mechanisms by which Gln3 modulates telomere length. Identification of a polymorphism in BUL2 in this outbred yeast population revealed a link among cellular amino acid availability, chronological lifespan, and telomere length control. © 2011 Kwan et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052325960

We previously demonstrated that lack of Nfat1, one of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors, causes OA-like changes in adult mice. This study aimed to identify whether Nfat1 specifically regulates adult articular chondrocyte function and its age-dependent regulatory mechanism using both Nfat1-deficient and wild-type mice. Deletion of Nfat1 did not induce OA-like articular chondrocyte dysfunction (e.g., overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading proteinases) until the adult stage. RNAi-mediated Nfat1 knockdown caused dysfunction of wild-type adult articular chondrocytes. Nfat1 expression in wild-type articular chondrocytes was low in the embryonic but high in the adult stage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that an increase in Nfat1 expression in articular chondrocytes was associated with increased H3K4me2 (a histone modification linked to transcriptional activation), whereas a decrease in Nfat1 expression in articular chondrocytes was correlated with increased H3K9me2 (a histone modification linked to transcriptional repression). Knockdown of lysine-specific demethylase-1 (Lsd1) in embryonic articular chondrocytes upregulated Nfat1 expression concomitant with increased H3K4me2 at the Nfat1 promoter. Knockdown of Jmjc-containing histone demethylase-2a (Jhdm2a) in 6-month articular chondrocytes downregulated Nfat1 expression concomitant with increased H3K9me2 at the Nfat1 promoter. These results suggest that Nfat1 is an essential transcriptional regulator of chondrocyte homeostasis in adult articular cartilage. Age-dependent Nfat1 expression in articular chondrocytes is regulated by dynamic histone methylation, one of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene transcription.

Most studies of reproductive senescence focus on females, leaving senescence in male function and its implications for female function largely understudied. We constructed linear mixed models to explore the interactive effects of paternal and maternal age and a life-history trait (i.e. age at first reproduction) on four fitness components (i.e. laying date, clutch size, number of fledglings and number of recruits) measured in a wild, breeding population of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus ogliastrae where individual breeding success has been followed for over 30 years (our dataset spanned 29 years). Previous studies have shown that, across female lifespan, laying date decreases and subsequently increases; earlier laying dates result in higher fitness because hatchlings have greater access to a seasonal food source. Our analyses reveal that females that initiate reproduction early in life show a greater delay in laying date with old age. In addition to delayed laying dates, older females lay smaller clutches. However, the magnitude of female age effects was influenced by the age at first reproduction of their breeding partners. Senescence of laying date and clutch size was reduced when females mated with males that reproduced early in life compared to males that delayed reproduction. We confirmed that both laying date and clutch size were significantly correlated with reproductive fitness suggesting that these dynamics early in the breeding cycle can have long-term consequences. These complex phenotypic interactions shed light on the proximate mechanisms underlying reproductive senescence in nature and highlight the potential importance of cross-sex age by life-history interactions. © 2011 The Authors.

Here, the influence of age of first reproduction on reproductive senescence and lifespan, and consequences for lifetime reproductive success (LRS), were examined using longitudinal reproductive records of male and female blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii) from two cohorts (1989 and 1991). The two sexes showed different relationships between age of first reproduction and rate of senescent decline: the earlier males recruited, the faster they experienced senescence in brood size and breeding success, whereas in females, recruiting age was unrelated to age-specific patterns of reproductive performance. Effects of recruiting age on lifespan, number of reproductive events and LRS were cohort-and/or sex-specific. Late-recruiting males of the 1989 cohort lived longer but performed as well over the lifetime as early recruits, suggesting the existence of a trade-off between early recruitment and long lifespan. In males of the 1991 cohort and females of both cohorts, recruiting age was apparently unrelated to lifespan, but early recruits reproduced more frequently and fledged more chicks over their lifetime than late recruits. Male boobies may be more likely than females to incur long-term costs of early reproduction, such as early reproductive senescence and diminished lifespan, because they probably invest more heavily than females. In the 1991 cohort, which faced the severe environmental challenge of an El Niño event in the first year of life, life-history trade-offs of males may have been masked by effects of individual quality. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958730141

Rather, they cause stress symptoms and may modulate the life history of aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, it is still not clear how HS interact with additional stressors and if their effects are transgenerational. We tested the interactive effects of HS and salt to cladocerans, discussing their consequences for the persistence in fluctuating environments, such as coastal lagoons. Methods: We used life-table experiments to test the effects of natural HS from a polyhumic coastal lagoon (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mg dissolved organic carbon (DOC) L-1) on the life-history of the cladoceran Moina macrocopa. We further tested the effects of HS (10 mg DOC L-1), within and across generations, on the resistance of M. macrocopa to salt stress (5.5 g L-1). Results: HS at 5-20 mg DOC L-1 extended the mean lifespan of M. macrocopa by ~30%. HS also increased body length at maturity by ~4% at 5-50 mg DOC L-1 and stimulated male offspring production at all tested concentrations. Exposure to HS (even maternal only) alleviated the salt-induced reduction of somatic growth. Co-exposure to HS increased body volume by 12-22% relative to salt-only treatments, while pre-exposure to HS increased body volume by 40-56% in treatments with salt presence, when compared to non-pre-exposed animals. Conclusions: HS at environmentally realistic concentrations, by acting as mild chemical stressors, modify crucial life-history traits of M. macrocopa, favoring its persistence in fluctuating environments.

Despite our extended lifespan, the length of the female reproductive period is shorter in humans than in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. Here, we investigate whether this difference could be explained by another unique aspect of human life history-a young weaning age. Methods: Age-dependent female fertility is modeled with the Brass polynomial. We model female reproductive period length as single locus with multiple alleles. Selection acts on the length of the female reproductive period in an evolutionary agent-based simulation. We quantify the effect of weaning age on the optimal length of the female reproductive period under a range of adult mortality rates. Results: Females sacrifice a smaller proportion of their reproductive potential due to nursing by weaning their offspring at younger ages. As a consequence, the optimal length of the female reproductive period decreases as weaning age decreases, even when adult mortality is low. Conclusions: Natural selection will favor mutations or strategies that can decrease weaning age without incurring fitness costs. In the presence of younger weaning ages, selection favors a shorter female reproductive period. To the extent that allocare can decrease weaning age without decreasing fitness, its ubiquity in human societies and near absence in other primate societies may explain why women have a shorter reproductive period. Furthermore, allocare may have provided human ancestors with an avenue to decreased weaning age-and, ultimately, a shorter female reproductive period-that was unavailable to their hominoid contemporaries. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958152238

Both were applied to biodemographic data by C. elegans to quantitatively explain that respiratory activity declines exponentially with age and that it has a physiological decline rate and a finite value (threshold) in advanced age. In this work, using the poikilothermic nature of Caenorhabditis elegans, we demonstrate the further validity of the rate theory of chemical reaction as well as the lifespan equation by changing two methods. First, to test the appropriateness of the lifespan equation from another aspect, lifespan assays were conducted by varying the time interval of observation employing the egl-1 mutant. The results indicate that, as the time interval is reduced, mortality rates gradually approach the force of mortality expected from the fitting equation of the survival curve. Second, based on the dependence of lifespan on the temperature of the culture, the physiological decline rate, and the onset of biodemographic aging, we show that the effective activation energy or energy barrier for aging and lifespan may be closely related to the standard free-energy change of ATP or ADP for a wild type and some lifespan-related mutants of C. elegans. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956291774

Vertebrate telomeres consist of tandem repeats of conserved TTAGGG sequence and associated proteins. Birds are interesting models for molecular studies on aging and cellular senescence because of their slow aging rates and longer life spans for their body size. In this longitudinal study, we explored the possibility of using telomeres as an age-marker to predict age in Single Comb White Leghorn layer chickens. We quantified the relative amount of telomeric DNA in isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes by the Quantitative Fluorescence in situ Hybridization technique on interphase nuclei (IQ FISH) using telomere-specific DNA probes. We found that the amount of telomeric DNA (ATD) reduced significantly with an increase in chronological age of the chicken. Especially, the telomere shortening rates are greatly increased in growing individuals compared to laying and old-aged individuals. Therefore, using the ATD values obtained by IQ FISH we established the possibility of age prediction in chickens based on the telomere theory of aging. By regression analysis of the ATD values at each age interval, we formulated an equation to predict the age of chickens.

However, most methods of survival estimation require substantial human and economic investment in the long term, particularly in species occurring in low densities, the case of most endangered species. An alternative to traditional recapture (CR) methods is estimation of adult survival based indirectly on either age ratios (AGR) or turnover rates (TOR) in territorial species. These 2 methods are applicable to bird species in which recruited individuals enter into the breeding population whilst still exhibiting the external traits that distinguish those animals from experienced adults. The main advantages of these methods are that survival can be easily estimated for all monitored individuals after just 1 or 2 breeding seasons and that disturbance to the species is minimized. The main constraints of indirect methods are that the assumptions are more restrictive than in CR methods, and survival estimates, although comparable between sites and years, may be biased. We used data from a long-term monitoring survey of 2 populations of the endangered Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata), one in Catalonia (NE Spain) and the other in Provence and Languedoc-Roussillon (SE France). We evaluated survival estimates using the AGR and TOR methods and compared them with CR methods and provide suitable corrections for refining survival estimates based on indirect methods. In Catalonia (2002-2008), survival was estimated at 0.84 byCR methods (SE = 0.047; n = 25 radio tagged eagles), at 0.86 by the corrected AGR method (SE = 0.011; n = 558 bird * year), and at 0.86 by the corrected TOR method (SE = 0.022; n = 547 bird * year). In France (1999-2008), survival was estimated at 0.88 by CR methods (SE = 0.040; n = 45 darvic banded eagles), at 0.87 by the corrected AGR method (SE = 0.015; n = 443 bird * year), and at 0.87 by the corrected TOR method (SE = 0.015; n = 438 bird * year). All analyses suggest that females survive better than males and that individuals from the French population survive better than individuals from the Catalan population. We conclude that indirect methods, which should not be regarded as a substitute of CR methods, will allow wildlife managers and researchers to estimate accurately adult survival in a territorial species over a short period of time and to monitor survival across populations over large geographic ranges and over time. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957594129

In India, it is prevalent only in the Nicobar district of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Knowledge of the population dynamics and bio-ecology of vectors is crucial to develop intervention measures. Entomological studies were performed for 12 months by collecting mosquitoes that landed on human baits for feeding in Teressa Island. Age composition, mosquitoes that had laid eggs at least once, finite rate of natural increase (λ) and vector survival reflecting the population dynamics of Do. nivea in relation to transmission of filariasis were estimated. A total of 3625 Do. nivea were collected. Changes in finite rate of increase (λ>1) during favorable months indicate an increase in the vector population, suggesting the need for intensified intervention. The proportion of mosquitoes completing more than one gonotrophic cycle was higher in months when λ was 1. Do. nivea abundance and its parous densities varied with seasons. Survival of Do. nivea (indicated by the proportion of parous mosquitoes) was lower in the pre-monsoon season than during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The probability of the daily survival of Do. nivea through one gonotrophic cycle was 0.75, with a declining trend as age increased. The maximum transmission of DSPWB occurred during the pre-monsoon, followed by the late monsoon, post-monsoon and monsoon seasons. Perennial transmission is evident. Therefore intervention measures must be planned throughout the year. Prospects of vector control are limited due to the cryptic breeding and diurnal biting habits.

This effect can engender age-specific variance in genetic contributions to evolutionary change in heritable traits under directional selection, particularly in age-structured populations. Using long-term population data of the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii), we tested whether genetic variance of recruiting age varies with parental age. Using robust quantitative genetic models fitted to pedigree, we found a significant genotype-by-paternal age interaction for recruiting age. Genetic potential for adaptive change in recruiting age was greater in progeny of young (age 1-6 years) fathers (males: CVA = 6.68; females: CVA = 7.59) than those of middle age (7-9 years) fathers (males: CVA = 4.64; females: CVA = 5.08) and old (10-14 years) fathers (CVA = 0 for both sexes). Therefore, parental age dependence of heritable variance, in addition to age-related variation in survival and fecundity, should affect the strength of natural selection for evolutionary changes.

Background: Mutations that impair mitochondrial functioning are associated with a variety of metabolic and age-related disorders. A barrier to rigorous tests of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in aging processes has been the lack of model systems with relevant, naturally occurring mitochondrial genetic variation. Toward the goal of developing such a model system, we studied natural variation in life history, metabolic, and aging phenotypes as it relates to levels of a naturally-occurring heteroplasmic mitochondrial ND5 deletion recently discovered to segregate among wild populations of the soil nematode, Caenorhabditis briggsae. The normal product of ND5 is a central component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and integral to cellular energy metabolism. Results: We quantified significant variation among C. briggsae isolates for all phenotypes measured, only some of which was statistically associated with isolate-specific ND5 deletion frequency. We found that fecundity-related traits and pharyngeal pumping rate were strongly inversely related to ND5 deletion level and that C. briggsae isolates with high ND5 deletion levels experienced a tradeoff between early fecundity and lifespan. Conversely, oxidative stress resistance was only weakly associated with ND5 deletion level while ATP content was unrelated to deletion level. Finally, mean levels of reactive oxygen species measured in vivo showed a significant non-linear relationship with ND5 deletion level, a pattern that may be driven by among-isolate variation in antioxidant or other compensatory mechanisms. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the ND5 deletion may adversely affect fitness and mitochondrial functioning while promoting aging in natural populations, and help to further establish this species as a useful model for explicit tests of hypotheses in aging biology and mitochondrial genetics. © 2011 Estes et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651250920

Methods: EGFR MASI was characterized by sequencing electropherograms (SEs) and EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 96 prospectively tested lung adenocarcinoma patients with a median follow-up of 20 months (all cases were EGFR mutation-positive). Results: In 25 cases, the mutant allele (MA) peak was higher than the wild-type allele (WA) peak, indicating the presence of EGFR MASI (25/96, 26%). The adenocarcinomas with EGFR MASI had a 4.4-fold higher average EGFR/Chromosome Enumeration Probe 7 ratio than carcinomas without MASI (7.9 ± 3.8 versus 1.8 ± 0.6, p = 0.01). A high degree of correlation between the MA/WA ratio (SE) and the EGFR/CEP7 ratio (FISH) (ρ = 0.757, p = 0.003) validated the quantitative nature of SE. Amplification was the most common mechanism of EGFR MASI (13/21, 62%). EGFR MASI was more commonly associated with exon 19 mutations than with exon 21 mutations (19/53, 36%, versus 6/43, 14%, p = 0.015, odds ratio [OR] = 3.4) and in patients younger than 65 years (17/46, 37%, versus 8/50, 16%, p = 0.019, OR = 3.1). Patients with EGFR MASI presented with stage IV disease more frequently (p = 0.01, OR = 3.5) and had a poorer disease-specific survival rate (p = 0.021, 54% versus 83% at 31 months). Conclusions: EGFR MASI in lung adenocarcinomas can be assessed based on SE and can be used to identify younger patients with more aggressive disease.

Recently, it has been suggested that telomeres, the ends of eukaryote chromosomes, might be useful in this context. However, little is known of the link between telomere length and fitness in natural populations and whether it is a useful indicator of biological state. We measured average telomere length in red blood cell samples taken from a wide age range of individuals of a very long-lived and highly sexually dimorphic seabird, the southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus). We examined the relationship with age, sex, and subsequent survival over an 8-year period. Telomere length was longer in chicks than adults. Within the adult group, which ranged in age from 12 to 40 years, telomere length was not related to age. For the first time in birds, there was some evidence of a sex difference. Male giant petrels, which are substantially larger than females, had significantly shorter telomere lengths than females. This difference was evident from an early stage in life and is likely to relate to differences in growth trajectories. Those adults that died during the 8-year time window following the telomere length measurement had significantly shorter telomere lengths than those that survived this period, irrespective of age or sex, neither of which were significant predictors of survival. These results show that relatively short telomere length is related to future life expectancy at any adult age, demonstrating its usefulness as a state variable. © The Author 2010.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952524560

Examples abound, but it is not well understood how such environmental changes influence the age structure of a population. I experimentally investigated the effects of water temperature and food type on age and body size at metamorphosis in larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus. In individuals grown at a cold temperature (15 °C) or given Chironomidae as prey, the time to metamorphosis was significantly prolonged, and body size at metamorphosis was significantly enlarged, compared with individuals grown at a warmer temperature (20 °C) or fed larvae. I also examined whether larval density (a possible indicator of cannibalism in natural habitats) generated variation in the age structure of natural populations in Hokkaido, Japan, where the climate is subarctic. Natural ponds in Hokkaido may contain larvae that have overwintered for 1 or 2 years, as well as larvae of the current year, and I found that the number of age classes was related to larval density. Although cool water temperatures prolong the larval period and induce later metamorphosis, in natural ponds diet-based enhancement of development translated into a shorter larval duration and earlier metamorphosis. Geographic variation in the frequency of cannibalism resulted in population differences in metamorphic timing in H. retardatus larvae. It is important to understand how environmental effects are ultimately transduced through individual organisms into population-level phenomena, with the population response arising as the summation of individual responses. Without a thorough comprehension of the mechanisms through which population and individual responses to environmental conditions are mediated, we cannot interpret the relationship between population-level and individual-level phenomena. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650057627

We also show the inability of oxidative theory to explain a number of indisputable facts easily explained by telomere theory, such as unlimited growth of tumor cells or why a newborn child starts to age from zero level rather than the level reached by the cells of his parents at the moment of conception. We postulate that if oxidative damage were entirely absent, telomeres would nevertheless shorten with each mitotic cycle, because such is the mechanism of DNA replication, and aging would progress, which we invariantly observe in the presence of any antioxidants. However, if telomeres do not shorten, as happens in transformed cells because telomerase works there, aging does cease and the transformed cells show no senescence.

Understanding the degree to which reproductive success varies with an individual's age and lifespan, and the degree to which population-level variation mirrors individual-level variation, is central to understanding life-history evolution and the dynamics of age-structured populations. We quantified variation in the survival probability of offspring, one key component of reproductive success and fitness, in relation to parent age and lifespan in a wild population of red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax). 2. On average across the study population, the first-year survival probability of offspring decreased with increasing parent age and lifespan; offspring of old parents were less likely to survive than offspring of young parents, and offspring of long-lived parents were less likely to survive than offspring of short-lived parents. 3. However, survival did not vary with parent age across offspring produced by groups of parents that ultimately had similar lifespans. 4. Rather, across offspring produced by young parents, offspring survival decreased with increasing parent lifespan; parents that ultimately had long lifespans produced offspring that survived poorly, even when these parents were breeding at young ages. 5. The average decrease in offspring survival with increasing parent age observed across the population therefore reflected the gradual disappearance of short-lived parents that produced offspring that survived well, not age-specific variation in offspring survival within individual parents. 6. The negative correlation between offspring survival and maternal lifespan was strongest when environmental conditions meant that offspring survival was low across the population. 7. These data suggest an environment-dependent trade-off between parent and offspring survival, show consistent individual variation in the resolution of this trade-off that is set early in a parent's life, and demonstrate that such structured life-history variation can generate spurious evidence of senescence in key fitness components when measured across a population. © 2010 The Authors.

We used program Mark to model patterns in nest survival within the breeding season for shorebirds nesting on arctic tundra. From 2000 to 2007, we monitored 521 nests of five shorebird species and found strong evidence for variation in nest survival within a nesting season. Daily nest survival was lowest in the mid-season in 5 of 8 years, but the timing and magnitude of the lows varied. We found no evidence that this quadratic time effect was driven by seasonal changes in weather or the abundance of predators. Contrary to our prediction, the risk of predation was not greatest when the number of active shorebird nests was highest. Although nest abundance reached a maximum near the middle of the breeding season, a daily index of shorebird nest activity was not supported as a predictor of nest survival in the models. Predators' access to other diet items, in addition to shorebird nests, may instead determine the temporal patterns of nest predation. Nest survival also displayed a positive, linear relationship with nest age; however, this effect was most pronounced among species with biparental incubation. Among biparental species, parents defended older nests with greater intensity. We did not detect a similar relationship among uniparental species, and conclude that the stronger relationship between nest age and both nest defence and nest survival for biparental species reflects that their nest defence is more effective. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953687542

Condition-dependent mortality occurs when there is an interaction between such factors; however, few studies have clearly demonstrated condition-dependent mortality and some have even argued that condition-dependent mortality does not occur in wild avian populations. Using large sample sizes (2084 individuals, 3746 re-sights) of individual-based longitudinal data collected over a 33 year period (1976-2008) on multiple cohorts, we used a capture-mark-recapture framework to model age-dependent survival in the snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus population in Florida. Adding to the growing amount of evidence for actuarial senescence in wild populations, we found evidence of senescent declines in survival probabilities in adult kites. We also tested the hypothesis that older kites experienced condition-dependent mortality during a range-wide drought event (2000-2002). The results provide convincing evidence that the annual survival probability of senescent kites was disproportionately affected by the drought relative to the survival probability of prime-aged adults. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of condition-dependent mortality to be demonstrated in a wild avian population, a finding which challenges recent conclusions drawn in the literature. Our study suggests that senescence and condition-dependent mortality can affect the demography of wild avian populations. Accounting for these sources of variation may be particularly important to appropriately compute estimates of population growth rate, and probabilities of quasi-extinctions. © 2009 The Authors.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953576207

Model selection based on Akaike's information criterion values adjusted for small size showed that the rate of aging decreases with increasing body mass, gestation period, age at maturity, and possession of flight. Among families of mammals, actuarial senescence was related to extrinsic mortality rate (standardized regression coefficient = 0.215), gestation period (-0.217), and age at maturity (-0.553). Although rate of aging in birds also was related to the embryo development period, birds grow several times more rapidly than mammals, and therefore, the connection between rate of early development and rate of aging is unclear. The strong vertebrate-wide relationship between rate of aging, or life span, and age at maturity can be explained by density-dependent feedback of adult survival rate on the recruitment of young individuals into the breeding population. Thus, age at maturity seems to reflect extrinsic mortality, which, in turn, influences selection on mechanisms that postpone physiological and actuarial senescence. Because rate of embryo development influences rate of aging independently of the age at maturity, in a statistical sense, the evolutionary diversification of development and aging seem to be connected in both birds and mammals; however, the linking mechanisms are not known.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953420606

We present the first estimates of hatchyear annual survival rates for a sea duck, the King Eider (Somateria spectabilis), estimated from satellite telemetry. from 2006 to 2008 we equipped pre-fledging King Eiders with satellite transmitters on breeding grounds in Alaska and estimated annual survival rates during their first 2 years of life with known-fate models. We compared those estimates to survival rates of adults marked in the same area from 2002 to 2008. Hatch-year survival varied by season during the first year of life, and model-averaged annual survival rate was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.48-0.80). We did not record any mortality during the second year and were therefore unable to estimate second-year survival rate. Adults' survival rate was constant through the year (0.94, 95% CI: 0.86-0.97). No birds appeared to breed during their second summer. While 88% of females with an active transmitter (n = 9) returned to their natal area at the age of 2 years, none of the 2-year old males (n = 3) did. This pattern indicates that females' natal philopatry is high and suggests that males' higher rates of dispersal may account for sex-specific differences in apparent survival rates of juvenile sea ducks when estimated with mark-recapture methods. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2010.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953474163

Other studies in humans also show that both sleep quantity and sleep quality decrease with age. Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model to study aging and sleep, and inheriting mutations affecting the potassium current Shaker results in flies that sleep less and have a shorter lifespan. However, whether the link between short sleep and reduced longevity exists also in wild-type flies is unknown. Similarly, it is unknown whether such a link depends on sleep amount per se, rather than on other factors such as waking activity. Also, sleep quality has been shown to decrease in old flies, but it remains unclear whether aging-related sleep fragmentation is a generalized phenomenon.Results: We compared 3 short sleeping mutant lines (Hk1, HkYand Hk2) carrying a mutation in Hyperkinetic, which codes for the beta subunit of the Shaker channel, to wild-type siblings throughout their entire lifespan (all flies kept at 20°C). Hk1and HkYmutants were short sleeping relative to wild-type controls from day 3 after eclosure, and Hk2flies became short sleepers about two weeks later. All 3 Hk mutant lines had reduced lifespan relative to wild-type flies. Total sleep time showed a trend to increase in all lines with age, but the effect was most pronounced in Hk1and HkYflies. In both mutant and wild-type lines sleep quality did not decay with age, but the strong preference for sleep at night declined starting in ""middle age"". Using Cox regression analysis we found that in Hk1and HkYmutants and their control lines there was a negative relationship between total sleep amount during the first 2 and 4 weeks of age and hazard (individual risk of death), while no association was found in Hk2flies and their wild-type controls. Hk1and HkYmutants and their control lines also showed an association between total daily wake activity over the first 2 and 4 weeks of age and hazard. However, when both sleep duration and wake activity were used in the same regression, the effects of activity were much reduced, while most of the sleep effects remained significant. Finally, Hk1flies and wild-type siblings were also tested at 25°C, and results were similar to those at 20°C. Namely, Hk1mutants were short sleeping, hyperactive, and short lived relative to controls, and sleep quality in both groups did not decrease with age.Conclusions: Different Hk mutations affect the sleep phenotype, and do so in an age-dependent manner. In 4 of the 6 lines tested sleep associates significantly with lifespan variation even after any effect of activity is removed, but activity does not associate significantly with lifespan after the effects of sleep are removed. Thus, in addition to environmental factors and genetic background, sleep may also affect longevity. Sleep quality does not necessarily decay as flies age, suggesting that aging-related sleep fragmentation may also depend on many factors, including genetic background and rearing conditions. © 2010 Bushey et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951565331

Unlike northern Europe and most of northern North America, the Eastern Palearctic and the northwesternmost tip of North America are believed to have been almost unglaciated during the Quarternary glacial periods. This could have facilitated long-term survival of many organisms in that area. To evaluate this, we studied the phylogeography in east Asia and Alaska of a boreal migratory passerine bird, the Arctic Warbler Phylloscopus borealis, and compared our results with published data on especially North American species. Results. In a sample of 113 individuals from 18 populations we identified 42 haplotypes of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, which separated into three clades: A - Alaska and mainland Eurasia (except Kamchatka); B - Kamchatka, Sakhalin and Hokkaido; and C - Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu (i.e. Japan except Hokkaido). The oldest split among these clades, between A/B and C, is estimated to have taken place sometime between the mid Pliocene and early Pleistocene, and the second divergence, between clades A and B, in the early to mid Pleistocene. Within all of the three main clades, there are signs of population expansion. Conclusions. The Arctic Warbler separated into three main clades in close succession around the Pliocene/Pleistocene border, with the two northern clades diverging last. All three clades probably experienced population bottlenecks during the Pleistocene as a result of range shifts and contractions, but nevertheless survived and maintained their integrities. Several other clades of Northeastern Palearctic birds are noted to have diversified during the Pliocene. In contrast, avian species or phylogroups presently occupying formerly glaciated North American ground are generally younger. The differences between these regions could be due to slower speciation rates in the Eastern Palearctic due to less fragmentation of forest habitats during glacial periods, or to longer survival of Eastern Palearctic clades as a result of less severe conditions in that region compared to northern North America. Several other Palearctic organisms show concordant biogeographical patterns to that of the Arctic Warbler, indicating common causes of their diversifications. © 2010 Saitoh et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950451589

It is shown that such redundancy may normally exist for organisms in the wild, and not only in domesticated and laboratory animals. Further development of the hormesis idea requires: (i) investigating regularities of response to multiple stimuli; (ii) studying slow-time responses (e.g., physiological adaptation) to repeated stimuli; (iii) studying connection between slow and fast (e.g., developing at the cellular and sub-cellular levels) stress responses; (iv) translating knowledge accumulated in studies of animal model systems to humans; (v) evaluating unrealized potential for improving health and longevity using hormetic mechanisms. The use of mathematical and computer modeling for translating experimental knowledge about hormesis effects to humans, as well as connection between studying hormetic mechanisms and analyses of the age trajectories of physiological and biological indices affecting U-shapes curves of morbidity-mortality risks using longitudinal data on aging, health, and longevity are discussed. © 2010 University of Massachusetts.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949558237

For many populations, some parameters, such as juvenile survival, are difficult to estimate accurately. In a simplified population model where fecundity and survival are constant from the onset of breeding, it is known that generation time may be calculated given only adult survival, age at first reproduction, and the population growth rate. However, the assumption of constant fecundity from the onset of breeding does not hold for many populations. An extended population model allows calculation of generation time with the additional knowledge of the ratio of age-specific fecundities compared to a maximum fecundity rate. When these relative fecundities are unknown, an ad hoc adjustment to the simplified model performs well. When the study population is in an ideal environment, the optimal generation time and maximum growth rate are linked, and both may be approximated knowing only adult survival, age at first reproduction, and the relative fecundities. The maximum growth rate has important conservation implications, and calculating it correctly is therefore important. Improper use of the simplified population model to calculate the maximum growth rate, combined with a simple decision rule, leads to an average overharvest of 36%, and >60% for three of six bird species studied, compared to the full population model. By comparison, using the approximation from the extended or adjusted models results in average overharvests of only 8% (extended model) and 5% (adjusted model), and <50% for all six species (either model). © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, in the presence of individual heterogeneity in survival probability, the proportion of high-survival individuals increases with age. This increase can mask a senescence-related decrease in survival probability when the probability is estimated at the population level. To accommodate individual heterogeneity we use a mixture model structure (discrete classes of individuals). Second, the study individuals can elude the observers in the field, and their detection rate can be heterogeneous. To account for detectability issues we use capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methodology, mixture models and data that provide information on individuals' detectability. Last, emigration to non-monitored sites can bias survival estimates, because it can occur at the end of the individuals' histories and mimic earlier death. To model emigration we use Markovian transitions to and from an unobservable state. These different model structures are merged together using hidden Markov chain CMR models, or multievent models. Simulation studies illustrate that reliable evidence for survival senescence can be obtained using highly heterogeneous data from non site-faithful individuals. We then design a tailored application for a dataset from a colony of black-headed gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus. Survival probabilities do not appear individually variable, but evidence for survival senescence becomes significant only when accounting for other sources of heterogeneity. This result suggests that not accounting for heterogeneity leads to flawed inference and/or that emigration heterogeneity mimics survival heterogeneity and biases senescence estimates. © 2009 The Authors.

This is predicted to manifest at the organismal level in the evolution of energy allocation strategies of investing in somatic maintenance and robust stress responses in less hazardous envirnments in exchange for energy spent on growth and reproduction. Here we report experiments from long-studied populations of western terrestrial garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) that reside in low and high extrinsic mortality environments, with evolved long and short life spans, respectively. Laboratory common-environment colonies of these two ecotypes were tested for a suite of physiological traits after control and stressed gestations. In offspring derived from control and corticosteronetreated dams, we measured resting metabolism; mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ATP and free radical production rates; and erythrocyte DNA damage and repair ability. We evaluated whether these aging biomarkers mirrored the evolution of life span and whether they were sensitive to stress. Neonates from the long-lived ecotype (1) were smaller, (2) consumed equal amounts of oxygen when corrected for body mass, (3) had DNA that damaged more readily but repaired more efficiently, and (4) had more efficient mitochondria and more efficient cellular antioxidant defenses than short-lived snakes. Many ecotype differences were enhanced in offspring derived from stress-treated dams, which supports the conclusion that nongenetic maternal effects may further impact the cellular stress defenses of offspring.

Results: Of the 2961 patients admitted with chronic heart failure, 753 had echocardiograms available for this analysis. Of these, 189 (25%) had normal left ventricular size and systolic function. In comparison to patients with LVSD, those with HFPSF were more often female (62.4% v 38.5%; P = 0.001), had less social support, and were more likely to live in nursing homes (17.9% v 7.6%; P < 0.001), and had a greater prevalence of renal impairment (86.7% v 6.2%; P = 0.004), anaemia (34.3% v 6.3%; P = 0.013) and atrial fibrillation (51.3% v 47.1%; P = 0.008), but significantly less ischaemic heart disease (53.4% v 81.2%; P = 0.001).

Recently it was demonstrated that BMAL1 deficiency results in premature aging in mice. Here we investigate the aging of mice deficient for CLOCK protein. Deficiency of the CLOCK protein significantly affects longevity: the average lifespan of Clock-/- mice is reduced by 15% compared with wild type mice, while maximum lifespan is reduced by more than 20%. CLOCK deficiency also results in the development of two age-specific pathologies in these mice, cataracts and dermatitis, at a much higher rate than in wild type mice. In contrast to BMAL1 deficient animals, Clock-/- mice do not develop a premature aging phenotype and do not develop the multiple age-associated pathologies characteristic of BMAL1 deficiency.

In a comparative study of flight initiation distance in 69 species of birds when approached by a human, I found that the amount of variance explained by flight initiation distance was more than four times as large for the horizontal than the vertical component of perch height when taking flight. The slope of the relationship between horizontal distance and flight initiation distance (horizontal slope) increased with increasing body mass across species, whereas the slope of the relationship between vertical distance and flight initiation distance (vertical slope) decreased with increasing body mass. Therefore, there was a negative relationship between horizontal and vertical slope, although this negative relationship was significantly less steep than expected for a perfect trade-off. The horizontal slope decreased with increasing density of the habitat from grassland over shrub to forest, whereas that was not the case for the vertical slope. Adult survival rate increased and rate of senescence (longevity adjusted for survival rate, body mass and sampling effort) decreased with increasing vertical, but not with horizontal slope, consistent with the prediction that vertical escape indeed provides a means of reducing the impact of predation. © 2010 The Author.

Mortality rates in this age-class are generally unknown in Europe where winter ringing predominates. We used data from large-scale wing collections from hunters in Finland, Denmark and France to test the prediction that juvenile proportions among killed Teal (Anas crecca) would decline with distance along the flyway. As expected, this proportion decreased from 89% in Northern Finland to 58% in Western France. Potential biases linked with age determination from the wings, differential migration of age-classes, relative susceptibility to different forms hunting and gradual improvement of juvenile survival as they learn to avoid hunters could not explain the observed decline of juveniles in the shot population. This pattern was therefore considered to be genuine, the result of the cumulative depletion of first-years along the flyway, likely through hunting. On this assumption, combined with known adult monthly survival rates during August-November (94.2%), monthly juvenile survival rate was estimated at 52.8%, i.e. 14. 7% (range 13.9-15.4% based on extreme values of adult survival) amongst Scandinavian juveniles reaching wintering quarters in Western France. Despite lack of precision in such estimates based on relative proportions, there is little doubt about the magnitude of autumn juvenile mortality and its consequences for the population dynamics of Teal. Lack of correlations between annual proportions of juveniles in the hunting bag and an index of Teal breeding success in Finland may result from such high and variable inter-annual mortality. © Dt.

Current methods of estimating avian age-specific nest survival rates require knowing the ages of nests, assuming homogeneous nests in terms of nest survival rates, or treating the hazard function as a piecewise step function. In this article, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with nest-specific covariates to estimate age-specific daily survival probabilities without the above requirements. The model provides a smooth estimate of the nest survival curve and identifies the factors that are related to the nest survival. The model can handle irregular visiting schedules and it has the least restrictive assumptions compared to existing methods. Without assuming proportional hazards, we use a multinomial semiparametric logit model to specify a direct relation between age-specific nest failure probability and nest-specific covariates. An intrinsic autoregressive prior is employed for the nest age effect. This nonparametric prior provides a more flexible alternative to the parametric assumptions. The Bayesian computation is efficient because the full conditional posterior distributions either have closed forms or are log concave. We use the method to analyze a Missouri dickcissel dataset and find that (1) nest survival is not homogeneous during the nesting period, and it reaches its lowest at the transition from incubation to nestling; and (2) nest survival is related to grass cover and vegetation height in the study area. © 2009, The International Biometric Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450233460

In 10 wild adults captured in the Klamath River, California, combined evaluation of the Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca ratios provided a clearer understanding of fish movements than the Sr:Ba ratio, probably because wild fish have a more complex life history. The Ba:Ca ratio dropped significantly between growth zones 1 and 2 (ages 0.5-1.5), indicating a transition into saline waters, such as the Klamath River estuary. The Sr:Ca ratio increased slightly in the same location but attained the values found in reference fish held in seawater between growth zones 3 and 4 (ages 2.5-3.5).

We investigated here how survival and recruitment probabilities changed with age at different geographical scales using the encounter histories of 5523 European storm petrels from three Mediterranean colonies, and also how our estimates of these parameters might be expected to affect population growth rates using population matrix models. We recorded similar patterns among colonies, but also important biological differences. Local survival, recruitment and breeding success increased with age at all colonies; the most distant of three colonies (Marettimo Is.) showed the largest differences. Strikingly, differences in recruitment were also found between two adjacent colonies (two caves from Benidorm Is.). Birds marked as adults from Marettimo and Benidorm colonies had a different survival, whereas we found no differences within Benidorm. Differences in survival were no longer apparent between the two islands at the end of the study following a reduction in predation by specialist gulls at Benidorm. Since birds marked as fledglings mostly recruited near the end of the study, their overall survival was high and in turn similar among colonies. Results from our population matrix models suggested that different age-dependent patterns of demographic parameters can lead to similar population growth rates. Variability appeared to be greater for recruitment and the most sensitive parameter was adult survival. Thus conservation actions targeting this vulnerable species should focus on factors influencing adult survival. Differences in survival and recruitment among colonies could reflect the spatial heterogeneity in mortality due to predation and colony-specific density dependent processes. Results highlight the importance of taking into account the potential spatio-temporal heterogeneity among populations in vital rates, even in those traits that life-history theory considers less important in driving population dynamics. © 2009 Ecography.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349137636

Telomere integrity is required for cell proliferation and survival. Although the vast majority of eukaryotic species use telomerase as a primary means for telomere maintenance, a few species can use recombination or retrotransposon-mediated maintenance pathways. Since Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use both telomerase and recombination to replicate telomeres, budding yeast provides a useful system with which to examine the evolutionary advantages of telomerase and recombination in preserving an organism or cell under natural selection. In this study, we examined the life span in telomerase-null, post-senescent type II survivors that have employed homologous recombination to replicate their telomeres. Type II recombination survivors stably maintained chromosomal integrity but exhibited a significantly reduced replicative life span. Normal patterns of cell morphology at the end of a replicative life span and aging-dependent sterility were observed in telomerase-null type II survivors, suggesting the type II survivors aged prematurely in a manner that is phenotypically consistent with that of wildtype senescent cells. The shortened life span of type II survivors was extended by calorie restriction or TOR1 deletion, but not by Fob1p inactivation or Sir2p over-expression. Intriguingly, rDNA recombination was decreased in type II survivors, indicating that the premature aging of type II survivors was not caused by an increase in extra-chromosomal rDNA circle accumulation. Reintroduction of telomerase activity immediately restored the replicative life span of type II survivors despite their heterogeneous telomeres. These results suggest that telomere recombination accelerates cellular aging in telomerasenull type II survivors and that telomerase is likely a superior telomere maintenance pathway in sustaining yeast replicative life span. © 2009 Chen et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651238707

Such epigenetic alterations are thus a possible source of heritable phenotypic variation in the absence of DNA sequence change. However, attempts to assess the prevalence of stable epigenetic variation in natural and experimental populations and to quantify its impact on complex traits have been hampered by the confounding effects of DNA sequence polymorphisms. To overcome this problem as much as possible, two parents with little DNA sequence differences, but contrasting DNA methylation profiles, were used to derive a panel of epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines (epiRILs) in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The epiRILs showed variation and high heritability for flowering time and plant height (∼30%), as well as stable inheritance of multiple parental DNA methylation variants (epialleles) over at least eight generations. These findings provide a first rationale to identify epiallelic variants that contribute to heritable variation in complex traits using linkage or association studies. More generally, the demonstration that numerous epialleles across the genome can be stable over many generations in the absence of selection or extensive DNA sequence variation highlights the need to integrate epigenetic information into population genetics studies. © 2009 Johannes et al.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651227407

Accordingly, sexually dimorphic optima in the allocation of resources to reproduction should select for sex-specific life histories, including sex-specific resolution of the key trade-off between reproduction and longevity. While males are expected to increase reproductive effort with increasing age under sexual selection theory, female reproductive effort should rather decrease after maturity, due to waning selection pressure at older ages. Sex differences in reproductive trade-offs and in the external mortality hazards experienced during the population's evolutionary history are both likely to shape sex differences in reproductive and actuarial (age-specific mortality) aging. Despite the importance of small-bodied, short-lived animals as laboratory models for life-history and aging studies, very little is known about sex differences in life-history patterns under natural conditions. Here, we tested for sex-specific patterns of reproductive and actuarial aging in field crickets under near-natural conditions. Both males and females showed actuarial senescence, with females exhibiting more rapid aging than males but with a later onset.

Here we have investigated telomere length in muscle and skin tissue of young and old fish of both strains using different methods. We found age-dependent telomere shortening in the MZM-0403 strain with the longer lifespan, whereas the short-lived GRZ strain showed no significant telomere shortening with advanced age. Sequencing of the two main telomerase genes Tert and Terc revealed that both genes are highly conserved between the N. furzeri strains while there is little conservation to other fish species and humans. Both genes are ubiquitously expressed in N. furzeri and expression levels of Tert and Terc correlate with telomerase activity in a tissue-specific manner. Unexpectedly, the expression level of Tert is increased in aged muscle and skin tissue of MZM-0403 suggesting that telomeres shorten upon ageing despite increased Tert expression and hence high telomerase activity.

In this paper we analyze the influence of parental age and body condition estimated by body mass, and food availability estimated from catch per unit effort (CPUE) statistics for Pacific sardine (Sardinops caeruleus) + northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) by the local fishing fleet, on the breeding parameters of the Heermann's Gull (Lams heermatmi; a vulnerable species according to Mexican federal law) nesting in Isla Rasa, Gulf of California, Mexico. Results are based on data from 1123 recaptures of known-age individuals, ranging from 4 to 13 years of age, during seven observation years between 1989 and 1997. Ages of mated male and female gulls were positively correlated. Breeding parameters showed their lowest values in 1992, an El Niño year in which the birds also showed significantly lower individual masses for both males and females, and in which the local CPUE of sardine + anchovies was lowest. All breeding parameters increased significantly with parental age and were highest at 10-12 years. No significant statistical interactions were found between food availability and parental age on the breeding parameters. Through a path analysis we found that there is a strong chained relationship between variables: food availability, which is strongly driven by océanographic conditions, affects both the survival of eggs into hatchlings and the survival of hatchlings into fledglings. This external factor and parental age, a biological factor intrinsic to each nesting couple, explain 41% of the observed between-nest variation in fledgling success. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63849173718

In such contexts the ability to perform each display or signal type in a consistent fashion may be under direct selection. Studies on sexual selection on song learning in birds have focused on differences in repertoire size with less attention paid to the potential importance of being able to perform each song/syllable type with high consistency. We investigated whether syllable type consistency is related to age, social dominance and reproductive success in tropical mockingbirds, Mimus gilvus. The variation between renditions of each syllable type decreased as the birds grew older (i.e. they became more consistent). In addition, more consistent males tended to have higher dominance status and reproductive success. These findings stress the importance of consistency in the performance of sexual displays and suggest that this parameter may be very relevant even in species that are selected for high vocal diversity (i.e. large repertoires). We hypothesize that, in addition to signalling dominance status and age, syllable type consistency may also indicate the integrity of brain function in birds analogous to the tests used for neuropsychological assessment in humans. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-59849095697

As part of an extensive adaptive management strategy built around a network of protected areas, an emphasis was placed on understanding this important species' life history. Multiple capture-mark-recapture techniques and a model selection approach to data analysis in Program MARK were used to estimate the effects of individual age and conspecific density on natural per-capita daily survival probabilities of yellow tang recruits (recently settled individuals, 30-50 mm total length) and the effects of body size and site on natural per-capita monthly survival probabilities for juveniles (58-127 mm total length). The models of recruit survival that included additive effects of density and age were best supported by the data and indicated an increase of survival with age and decrease of survival with increased conspecific density. At 1 day post-settlement, the model averaged daily per-capita survival probability ranged from 0.963 (95% CI: 0.932-0.981) at a low density of 0.1 recruits m -2 to 0.848 (95% CI: 0.752-0.911) at a high density of 1.3 recruits m-2.

Only about 1% of recruits may survive to adulthood when protected from fishing. These results can be used to better analyze and interpret data from protected area monitoring surveys and refine management practices.

We know comparatively little about the relationship between testosterone and life-history stages for non-seasonally breeding species. Here we examine testosterone profiles across the life span of males from three non-seasonally breeding primates: yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus or P. hamadryas cynocephalus), chacma baboons (Papio ursinus or P. h. ursinus), and geladas (Theropithecus gelada). First, we predict that testosterone profiles will track the reproductive profiles of each taxon across their respective breeding years. Second, we evaluate age-related changes in testosterone to determine whether several life-history transitions are associated with these changes. Subjects include males (> 2.5 years) from wild populations of each taxon from whom we had fecal samples for hormone determination. Although testosterone profiles across taxa were broadly similar, considerable variability was found in the timing of two major changes: (1) the attainment of adult levels of testosterone and (2) the decline in testosterone after the period of maximum production. Attainment of adult testosterone levels was delayed by 1 year in chacmas compared with yellows and geladas. With respect to the decline in testosterone, geladas and chacmas exhibited a significant drop after 3 years of maximum production, while yellows declined so gradually that no significant annual drop was ever detected. For both yellows and chacmas, increases in testosterone production preceded elevations in social dominance rank.

In addition to a permanent cessation of fertile potential, the loss of cyclic ovarian function in humans heralds the onset of menopause, which in turn underlies the emergence of a diverse spectrum of health issues in aging women. Recently, it was reported that bone marrow (BM) transplantation (BMT) into adult female mice conditioned a week earlier with highly cytotoxic drugs rescues ovarian function and fertility. Herein we show in mice receiving no prior conditioning regimen that once-monthly infusions of BM-derived cells retrieved from young adult female donors bearing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgene sustain the fertile potential of aging wild-type females long past their time of normal reproductive senescence. The fertility-promoting effects of female donor BM are observed regardless whether the infusions are initiated in young adult or middle-aged females. Although the mechanism by which BM infusions benefit the reproductive performance of aging females remains to be elucidated, the absence of EGFP-expressing offspring suggests that it does not depend on development of mature eggs derived from germline-committed cells in the donor marrow. However, donor BM-derived somatic cells accumulate in the recipients, indicating efficient donor cell engraftment without prior conditioning.

Additionally, we report ""genetic value,"" or the number of young remaining to be recruited into the breeding population by individuals of age x. Controlling for age of mate, the presence of some individuals in multiple years, and the effect of year of breeding, reproduction and survival peaked in middle-aged birds of each sex and declined later in life for the oldest individuals. We could not exclude the selection hypothesis (removal of inferior individuals) as an explanation for improved female reproduction until middle age. The age at last reproduction was a significant determinant of age-related reproductive success, indicating a disappearance of low-quality individuals. Yearling females that did not successfully reproduce had greater within-season emigration than all other age classes of each sex, regardless of the reproductive success of other classes. For males, we favored the constraint hypothesis (improved reproduction with experience) to explain greater reproductive output with increasing age until at least middle age. For each sex, the age of the mate independently influenced all measures of reproductive performance, but there was generally a linear or quadratic, rather than interactive, effect of the mate's age on reproduction. For both sexes, hypotheses of age-related reproduction were only partially supported because of effects of senescence, or a decline in reproductive output or survival probabilities with increasing age.

Researchers often turn to estimating survival during the prefledging period and, though effective, mark-recapture based approaches are not always feasible due to cost, time, and animal welfare concerns. Using a threatened population of Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) that breeds along the Missouri River, we present an approach for estimating chick survival during the prefledging period using long-term (1993-2005), count-based, age-class data. We used a modified catch-curve analysis, and data collected during three 5-day sampling periods near the middle of the breeding season. The approach has several ecological and statistical assumptions and our analyses were designed to minimize the probability of violating those assumptions. For example, limiting the sampling periods to only 5 days gave reasonable assurance that population size was stable during the sampling period. Annual daily survival estimates ranged from 0.825 (SD = 0.03) to 0.931 (0.02) depending on year and sampling period, with these estimates assuming constant survival during the prefledging period and no change in the age structure of the population. The average probability of survival to fledging ranged from 0.126 to 0.188. Our results are similar to other published estimates for this species in similar habitats.

In vertebrates, maternal antibodies (matAb) are transferred from the mother, via the placenta, egg yolk or milk during lactation to offspring until they are 2 weeks (birds), 4-10 weeks (rodents) and 9 months (humans) old, respectively. matAb transfer can have direct effects on offspring growth rate in birds and rodents, probably by passively protecting the newborn from common pathogens before their endogenous immune system has matured. Indirect long-term effects of matAb transfer on the offspring's own immunity can be synergistic, if matAb act as antigen templates of the accumulated immunological experience of the mother and educate the newborn's immune system. However, it may also be suppressive if matAb reduce antigen presentation to the newborn resulting in antigen-specific blocking of offspring endogenous immunity.

Furthermore, we found no negative correlation between host yolk IgG levels and parasite fecundity. Thus, whereas previous work has unequivocally shown that prenatal maternal effects play a crucial role in shaping the parasite resistance of nestling birds, our study indicates that other egg components, such as hormones, carotenoids or other immuno-active substances, which bird females can adjust more quickly than yolk IgG, might mediate these effects. © 2008 The Authors.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149096967

Trade-offs in resource allocation underline the evolution of life-history traits but their expression is frequently challenged by empirical findings. In large herbivores, males with large antlers or horns typically have high mating success. The fitness costs of large horns or antlers have rarely been quantified although they are controversial. 2. Here, using detailed longitudinal data on n = 172 bighorn (Ovis canadensis, Shaw) and the capture-mark-recapture methodology, we tested whether early horn growth leads to a survival cost in rams ('trade-off' hypothesis) or if males that can afford rapid horn growth survive better than males of lower phenotypic quality ('phenotypic quality' hypothesis). We also quantified how hunting increased survival costs of bearing large horns. 3. We found an age-specific relationship between horn growth and survival. In all age classes, natural survival was either weakly related to (lambs, adult rams) or positively associated (yearling rams) with early horn growth. Hunting mortality was markedly different from natural mortality of bighorn rams, leading to an artificial negative association between early horn growth and survival. Beginning at age 4, the yearly harvest rate ranged from 12% for males with the smallest horns up to more than 40% for males with the largest horns. 4. Growing large horns early in life is not related to any consistent survival costs, hence supporting the phenotypic quality hypothesis in males of a dimorphic and polygynous large herbivores. Rapid horn growth early in life is, however, strongly counter selected by trophy hunting. We suggest that horn size is a very poor index of reproductive effort and that males modulate their mating activities and energy allocation to horn growth to limit its impact on survival. © 2008 The Authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-57549087408

All subjects underwent anthropometric measurements and motor performance testing (flexibility, muscle resistance/strength and cardiorespiratory fitness). Statistical analysis employed the Levene test to verify the homogeneity of variation, descriptive statistics, single factor ANOVA (age group) and the Bonferroni test. The significance level adopted was p<0.05. The best levels of physical fitness were observed among the youngest subjects (G1), irrespective of sex, while the worst fitness levels were detected in the oldest subjects (G3). The variation in body fat from G1 to G3 was more accentuated among the men (34%) than among the women (16%). With relation to motor performance, the greatest percentage differences between G1 and G3 were detected by either modified abdominal test (39% and 22%, for men and women respectively) and the arm flexion and extension test (31% and 24%, for men and women respectively.

In addition to studying seed input, we looked at the effects of vegetation control, ground preparation and protection from small mammals on seedling emergence and survival. Over a 3-year period (February 2001 to March 2004), there was enough seed production and seedling survival to conclude that natural regeneration could be successful beneath a 50-year-old stand of Corsican pine in the south of England. Peaks of pine seed release occurred in March/April in 2002 and 2003, but it was extremely surprising to observe that some seed was trapped in virtually every month of the 3-year study, demonstrating an almost continual release of (at least) small quantities of seeds. In line with this finding, although most pine seedlings were found shortly after peak seed dispersal in May, June and July; new seedlings were found in every month throughout the study except February and October.

Yet the extent to which parent age affects offspring viability is likely to vary between different aspects of growth and survival, perhaps being most pronounced at the most stressful stages of reproduction. We studied the link between parent age and nestling growth and survival in the Laysan albatross, a long-lived seabird with a mean first breeding age of 8 years. Offspring of older parents were more likely to survive to fledging. Among those that did fledge, nestlings of older parents grew more rapidly. However, parent age did not influence the eventual asymptotic size that nestlings reached before fledging: fast-growing nestlings of older parents reached 90% of asymptotic size roughly 1 week sooner, but slow-growing nestlings of younger parents eventually caught up in size before fledging. Older parents bred c. 2 days earlier than younger parents, but hatch date did not explain observed variation in offspring success. The extent to which parent age accounted for variation in size of individual nestlings was not constant but peaked near the midpoint of development. This could reflect a time period when demands on parents reveal age-based differences in parental quality. Overall, growth and survival of offspring increased with parent age in this species, even though the late age of first breeding potentially provides a 7-year period for birds to hone their foraging skills or for selection to eliminate low-quality individuals. © 2008 The Authors.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649101280

However, the effects of telomere uncapping on normal epithelial cells have not previously been examined. We have used the well characterised telomere repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) dominant-negative mutant, TRF2ΔBΔM, to deplete Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK) telomeres of TRF2. We observed only a two fold increase in both phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and 53BP1 DNA damage foci and no detectable increase in p21WAF. Despite the weak DNA damage response, the keratinocytes growth arrest, demonstrate reduced colony formation and senescence. The small, abortive senescent colonies did not incorporate Brd-U within 48 h and expressed senescence-associated beta galactosidase (SA-β-gal). Transcriptional profiling of TRF2-depleted keratinocytes showed a reproducible up-regulation of several genes. These included histones, genes associated with DNA damage and keratinocyte terminal differentiation. Several of the same genes were also shown to be up-regulated when keratinocytes undergo natural telomere-mediated senescence and down-regulated by ectopic telomerase expression. This study has thus revealed highly sensitive and specific candidate indicators of telomere dysfunction that may find use in identifying telomere-mediated keratinocyte senescence in ageing, cancer and other diseases. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We thus brought reference life tables and deconvolution models to bear on medfly mortality data gathered from a 3-year study of field-captured individuals that were monitored in the laboratory. The average time-to-death of captured females differed between sampling dates by 23.9, 22.7, and 37.0 days in the 2003, 2004, and 2005 field seasons, respectively. These shifts in average times-to-death provided evidence of changes in population age structure. Estimates indicated that middle-aged medflies (> 30 days) were common in the population.

The majority of experimental studies that contribute to our understanding of this oak recruitment pattern in California have been relatively short-term, conducted on a small-scale. Thus, while we have valuable information about the array of factors that are able to limit seedling establishment, we know much less about their relative importance, and how they vary across years, sites, or age classes. To investigate the impacts of factors limiting seedling and sapling establishment of valley oak (Quercus lobata) and coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) across a landscape and over time we replicated experiments in four different years in Santa Barbara County, California. Experimental factors manipulated included cattle grazing, and access by deer and small mammals. Plots were distributed across three sites with a cumulative area of 200-ha, and seedling survival was recorded for a minimum of 5 years. We used classification and regression tree analysis (CART) to examine the relative importance of factors influencing survival of planted oaks at different life stages. The relative importance of limiting factors varied among age classes for both species. For initial seedling emergence and survival to 6 months planting year was the most important factor and rodent access was the second most important factor for both Q. lobata and Q. agrifolia. For survival of seedlings through their 1st year rodents, planting year, and site were major limiting factors, though their relative importance varied between the two species. For survival from 1.5 to 5 years, Q. lobata was strongly affected by rodents and site, while Q. agrifolia was mainly affected by site, deer browsing (which reduced survival), and indirect effects of winter-spring cattle grazing (which improved survival). Contrary to our expectations, based on observed patterns of natural recruitment, Q. agrifolia had equivalent or lower survivorship than Q. lobata in all seedling age classes. Overall, in addition to other factors, there were strong year and site effects controlling oak seedling emergence and survival and the relative importance of limiting factors depended on seedling age. Our results suggest that large-scale, long-term experiments encompassing multiple sites will improve our understanding of controls on recruitment in oak woodlands in California and elsewhere. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This may be a consequence of irregularity and acyclicity of the oestrous cycle of the middle-aged mutants. Besides, we demonstrate that Per mutant females have significantly more embryonal implantations in the uterus than successfully delivered offspring.

We demonstrate that impaired maternal care leads to offspring exhibiting increased neophobia and decreased exploratory behaviour. However, these effects were limited to female offspring only, with male offspring being indistinguishable from wild types in both the open-field and the novel object tests. Due to the breeding design of this study we were able to show that this was due not to the inheritance of a genetic mutation but to an epigenetic inheritance. Consistent with this, we also observed a nongenomic inheritance of impairments in maternal care. Wild-type daughters born to mutant mothers were impaired in their ability to retrieve pups to a nest in a retrieval test. Furthermore, the reduced exploration and neophobic phenotypes were transmitted to a third generation, with the granddaughters of mutant females exhibiting increased neophobia even though they had genetically wild-type mothers.

We use pedigree and life-history data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to test for additive and interactive effects of age and individual inbreeding coefficient (f) on fitness components, and thereby assess the evidence for MA.

ARS declined with f in both sexes and survival declined with f in males, indicating inbreeding depression in fitness. We observed a significant age×f interaction for male ARS (reflecting increased inbreeding depression as males aged), but not for female ARS or survival in either sex.

Telomere length has been used to estimate age in free-living populations of animals. Such estimation is a potentially powerful tool in the context of population dynamics and management, as well as the study of life-history trade-offs. The number of studies utilizing telomere restriction fragment assays in the fields of ecology and evolution is steadily growing. However, the field lacks methodological and analytical standardization resulting in considerable variation in telomere length and therefore in the usefulness of these techniques. Here, we illustrate new laboratory and analytical methods to reliably measure telomere length from blood erythrocytes and accurately assess the relationship between telomeres and age. We demonstrate the importance of analysing those telomeres most relevant to age-related studies: the shortest telomeres. We present a reliable method to quickly identify an analysis window (the telomere optimal estimate, TOE) which approaches the optimal window for age estimation. Because the TOE focuses on the shortest telomeres - those telomeres which signal cellular senescence and ageing - TOE can also be used to compare telomeres in age-matched individuals. We also compare constant- and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to show how each can influence telomere measurement. The use of TOE should provide powerful telomere-based age estimation and enable organismal biologists to readily uncover individual and longitudinal differences with regard to telomere dynamics. © 2007 The Authors.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949098461

We analyzed the reproductive success of wild-caught males at their normal breeding age during the mating season and after maintaining the males in laboratory from 1 to 5 months. In line with the mutation accumulation theory of aging, none of the factors affecting the reproductive success of wild-caught males during the mating season were related to male longevity. However, mating activity and progeny production of the males decreased with male age. Interestingly, there was no significant variation in progeny production between males at their normal breeding age, whereas at older age, the variation between males becomes significant. The quality of sexually selected song traits deteriorated with male age in concert with the decrease in male reproductive success. The size of the males did not have an effect on male reproductive success at the normal breeding age, but at older age, larger males were able to maintain the sexually selected carrier frequency of the song at higher level than the smaller males. We conclude that by experimentally extending the reproductive age of the males beyond that which they normally experience in nature, it is possible to expose relationships between reproductive success, sexually selected characters, and body size that are not apparent when analyzed for the males at their normal breeding age. © The Author 2007.

However, the patterns of settlement in wild populations of large mammals are often poorly described owing to the difficulty of monitoring mother-offspring pairs over a long period. Here, we investigated sex-specific settlement patterns in chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra (L., 1758)) based on the study of 31 mother-offspring pairs. We calculated the distance between the center of the mother's range and the center of her offspring's range, and tested whether this distance differed when the offspring was immature (i.e., a yearling) and after offspring sexual maturity (>2 years of age). We found no sex effect on the distance between centers of mother and offspring ranges for yearling offsprings. However, mature sons ranged farther away from their mother than mature daughters. Daughters appear to settle close to their mother's home range. The distance at which a daughter settles compared with her mother's range seems to be determined before 2 years of age. On the contrary, the distance between the center of the locations of yearling males and the center of locations of their mother does not predict how far away males will eventually settle when mature.

Germination experiments were conducted in greenhouse conditions and seedling survival was assessed in controlled and natural areas. We found that M. huitzilopochtli has non-dormant seeds and that germination occurred during the first seven days after sowing for seeds less than one year old (x- = 90%). Germination decreased with time, which indicated that this species might be able to form a transient seed bank (maximum one year old). Scarification treatments in M. huitzilopochtli did not interact with seed age response and did not enhance germination percentages, asserting that seeds are nondormant.

In an initial pilot study of 23 progeroid cases without detectable WRN or LMNA mutations, however, no cases of altered LMNA copy number were detected.

Although food availability, as indicated by commercial fish catches, throughout this breeding period was low, there were no significant differences in breeding success or chick growth between groups.

Established schemes such as capture-recapture often are not feasible. In the proposed residual demography paradigm, individuals are randomly sampled from the wild population at unknown ages and the resulting captive cohort is reared out in the laboratory until death. Under some basic assumptions one obtains a demographic convolution equation that involves the unknown age distribution of the wild population, the observed survival function of the captive cohort, and the observed survival function of a reference cohort that is independently raised in the laboratory from birth. We adopt a statistical penalized least squares method for the deconvolution of this equation, aiming at extracting the age distribution of the wild population under suitable constraints. Under stationarity of the population, the age density is proportional to the survival function of the wild population and can thus be inferred. Several extensions are discussed.

In many vertebrates, reproductive performance increases with advancing age but mechanisms involved in such a pattern remain poorly studied. One potential mechanism may be the hormonal stress response, which shifts energy investment away from reproduction and redirects it towards survival. In birds, this stress response is achieved through a release of corticosterone and is also accompanied by a decrease in circulating prolactin, a hormone involved widely in regulating parental cares. 2. It has been predicted that, when the value of the current reproduction is high relative to the value of future reproduction and survival, as it is expected to be in older adults, the stress response should be attenuated to ensure that reproduction is not inhibited. 3. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the corticosterone and prolactin responses of known-age (8-36 years old) incubating snow petrels (Pagadroma nivea) to a standardized capture/handling stress protocol. We also investigated whether an attenuation of the stress responses will correlate with a lower occurrence of egg neglect, a frequently observed behaviour in snow petrels. 4. The probability of successfully fledging a chick increased from 6 years to 12 years before stabilizing after 12 years of age. Corticosterone response to stress was unaffected by age. Prolactin response to stress, however, was influenced clearly by age: in both sexes older breeders had higher stress-induced prolactin levels than younger ones. This was due to an increasing attenuation of the prolactin response to stress with advancing age in females, and in males this was due to a probably higher intrinsic capacity of older males to secrete prolactin. Moreover, higher stress-induced prolactin levels were correlated with a lower probability of neglecting the egg. 5. In young breeders, the combination of a robust corticosterone increase with a lower ability to maintain prolactin secretion during acute stress is probably one of the functional causes of their lower incubation commitment. We suggest that the ability to maintain a threshold level of prolactin during a stressful situation may be an important physiological mechanism involved in the improvement of reproductive performance with advancing age in long-lived birds. © 2007 The Authors.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-35148823548

Plover chicks were most likely to die in the first three days of their 28-day prefledging period, especially on sandy ocean beaches compared to coarser substrates of river habitats. Chick survival in both habitats increased across the ∼120-day chick-rearing period. Improved survival of older chicks coincided with an age-related reduction in brooding and increased distance from the tending parent, which was not related to season. Lower survival of younger chicks was correlated with a tendency to lie motionless when approached by humans; nearly all older chicks responded to human approach by running to evade danger. Chicks of all ages were more likely to lie motionless when potential avian predators flew nearby.

While deletion of PaAmid1 as well as of PaMca2 was found to result in a moderate lifespan extension (59% and 78%, respectively), a 148% increase in lifespan was observed after deletion of PaMca1. Measurement of arginine-specific protease activity demonstrates a metacaspase-dependent activity in senescent but not in juvenile cultures, pointing to an activation of these proteases in the senescent stage of the life cycle. Moreover, treatment of juvenile wild-type cultures with hydrogen peroxide leads to a PaMCA1-dependent activity.

Age-specific survival of 215 males and 117 females of the highly sexually dimorphic Alpine ibex Capra ibex (L.) was assessed from a 21-year capture-mark-recapture (CMR) programme (1983-2004). The study covered two contrasted periods of population performance (high performance from 1983 to 1997 vs. low performance from 1998 onwards). 2. Based on current life-history theories for sexually dimorphic species, we expected that survival should decrease with age in both sexes, female survival should be buffered against environmental variations, male survival should decrease during the low performance period, and adult survival should be lower in males than females during the low performance period. 3. Survival of both sexes was strongly affected by age, with the four age classes (yearling, prime-aged adults of 2-8 years of age, old adults of 8-13 years of age, and senescent adults from 13 years of age onwards) generally reported for large herbivores. 4. Survival of females at all ages, and of yearling and prime-aged males, was buffered against environmental variations and was the same during periods of high and low population performance. The survival of old males decreased in years of low population performance. 5. All marked yearlings (32 females, 56 males) survived to age 2. Survival of prime-aged females (0.996 ± 0.011) was higher than for other large herbivores, but similarly to other large herbivore species, it declined slowly and regularly with increasing age afterwards. Male survival was 5-15% higher each year than that of males of other large herbivores. Males enjoyed very high survival when prime-aged (0.981 ± 0.009) and as old adults (high-performance period: 0.965 ± 0.028, low-performance period: 0.847 ± 0.032). 6. The very high survival of males, coupled with their prolonged mass gain, suggests a highly conservative reproductive tactic. Male ibex differ from similar-sized herbivores by showing a nearly indeterminate growth in horn size and body mass. By surviving to an advanced age, males may enjoy high reproductive success because of their large size. © 2007 The Authors.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250760284

Robust estimates of demographic parameters are essential for identifying population declines and planning effective management. We evaluated the effects of age and season on the survival of female lesser prairie-chickens at 2 sites in southwestern Kansas, USA. Using telemetry data from a 7-year field study (from 1997 to 2003), we estimated seasonal (Apr-Sep) and annual (Apr-Mar) survival. We also examined daily survival rates of females attending nests during the 26-day incubation period and young during the 14-day early brood-rearing period. We evaluated the probable mortality causes of radiomarked birds by examining evidence at recovery sites. We captured 227 female lesser prairie-chickens (87 yearlings, 117 ad, and 23 age undetermined) and fitted them with radiotransmitters. Estimates of 12-month survival were lower among yearlings (Ŝ12 = 0.429, SE = 0.117) and adults at site I (Ŝ12 = 0.302, SE = 0.080) than among yearlings (Ŝ12 = 0.588, SE = 0.100) and adults at site II (Ŝ12 = 0.438, SE = 0.083). The patterns in timing of mortality and age-specific 6-month survival were consistent with those of 12-month estimates at site I from 1998 to 2002, with a peak in mortality during May and June. Females tending to nests or to prefledged chicks had lower daily survival (DŜRtend = 0.993, SE = 0.001) than females not involved in these activities (DŜRfailedbreeder = 0.997, SE = 0.002). We recorded 92 mortalities from April 1997 to March 2003, and 59% and 11% were attributed to predation by mammals and raptors, respectively. Our research suggests that predation during the nesting season can have a major impact on lesser prairie-chicken demography, and conservation efforts should focus on enhancing female survival during the nesting and brood-rearing seasons.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53949096123

We also asked whether changes in seed paternity affected offspring success in an experimental garden. While flower age did not affect seed paternity, there was a dramatic shift in pollen donor performance as plants aged. These differences were seen in the offspring as well, where the offspring of one pollen donor, which sired more seeds on young plants, flowered earlier in the season, and the offspring of another pollen donor, which sired more seeds on old plants, flowered later in the season. Thus, change in maternal condition resulted in altered seed paternity, perhaps because the environment for pollen tube growth was different.

Results: Hurricane Katrina significantly influenced decisions to evacuate in disasters. Over 70% said they would definitely evacuate in the future and nearly 16% would probably evacuate, yet over 13% reported ""maybe"" or ""no."" Multiple logistic regressions suggest that those who do not trust their TV and county officials' information would have only 1/4 the odds of definitely evacuating.

Unpredictable and disparate age of cancer onset is a major challenge in the management of LFS. Genetic modifiers, including the MDM2-SNP309 polymorphism, and genetic anticipation have been suggested as plausible explanations for young age of tumor onset, but the molecular mechanisms for these observations are unknown. We speculated that telomere attrition will increase genomic instability and cause earlier tumor onset in successive generations. We analyzed mean telomere length and MDM2-SNP309 polymorphism status in individuals from multiple LFS families and controls. A total of 45 peripheral blood lymphocyte samples were analyzed from 9 LFS families and 15 controls. High rate of MDM2-SNP309 was found in TP53 carriers (P = 0.0003). In children, telomere length was shorter in carriers affected with cancer than in nonaffected carriers and wild-type controls (P < 0.0001). The same pattern was seen in adults (P = 0.002). Within each family, telomere length was shorter in children with cancer than in their nonaffected siblings and their noncarrier parents. Telomere attrition between children and adults was faster in carriers than in controls. Our results support the role of MDM2-SNP309 as a genetic modifier in LFS. The novel finding of accelerated telomere attrition in LFS suggests that telomere length could explain earlier age of onset in successive generations of the same family with identical TP53/MDM2-SNP309 genotypes. Furthermore, telomere shortening could predict genetic anticipation observed in LFS and may serve as the first rational biological marker for clinical monitoring of these patients. ©2007 American Association for Cancer Research.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847691863

We conducted a mark-recapture study of Crotalus horridus from 1978-2002 in northeastern New York near the northern limits of the species' range. We marked 588 neonates and estimated annual age-, sex-, and morph-specific recapture and survival rates using the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model. Wild-caught neonates (field-born, n = 407) and neonates produced by captive-held gravid females (lab-born, n = 181) allowed comparison of the birthplace, or lab treatment effect, in estimated survival. Recapture rates declined from about 10-20% over time while increasing from young to older age classes. Estimated survival rates (S ± 1 SE) in the first year were significantly higher among field-born (black morph: S = 0.773 ± 0.203; yellow morph: S = 0.531 ± 0.104) than among lab-born snakes (black morph: S = 0.411 ± 0.131; yellow morph: S = 0.301 ± 0.081). Lower birth weights combined with a lack of field exposure until release apparently contributed to the lower survival rate of labborn snakes. Subsequent survival estimates for 2-4-yr-old snakes were S = 0.845 ± 0.084 for the black morph and S = 0.999 (SE not available) for the yellow morph, and for ≥5-yr-old snakes S = 0.958 ± 0.039 (black morph) and S = 0.822 ± 0.034 (yellow morph). The most parsimonious model overall contained an independent time trend for survival of each age, morph, and lab-treatment group. For snakes of the first two age groups (ages 1 yr and 2-4 yr), survival tended to decline over the years for both morphs, while for adult snakes (5 yr and older), survival was constant or even slightly increased. Our data on survival and recapture are among the first rigorous estimates of these parameters in a rattlesnake and among the few yet available for any viperid snake.

Three hundred and six old-growth trees and 195 naturally regenerating seedlings were genotyped at 5 microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was similar across old-growth life stages and within the clear-cut seedlings. Significant inbreeding was found in the adult class (30+ cm diameter at breast height) of old-growth seedlings and in the adjacent natural regeneration. Relatedness was significantly associated with physical distance for both the oldest age class and for regenerating seedlings in the adjacent clear-cut, whereas intermediate classes showed no such association. As intermediate classes show no isolation by distance, the associations that arise probably occur from single cohort regeneration that clearly has taken place in the clear-cut, and possibly when the oldest old-growth trees were established. Parentage analysis suggested that large-scale fragmentation, such as this clear-cut, allowed for increased long-distance seed dispersal. We conclude that long-lived tree populations can consist of a cohort mosaic, reflecting the effects of fragmentation, and resulting in a complex, age-dependent, local population structure with high levels of genetic diversity. © The American Genetic Association. 2006.

In variable environments, fitness is measured by the stochastic growth rate λs, and stochastic sensitivities estimate selection pressure. Here we examine age-specific schedules for reproduction and survival in a barn owl population (Tyto alba). We estimated how temporal variability affected fitness and selection, accounting for sampling variance. Despite large sample sizes of old individuals, we found no strong evidence for senescence. The most variable fitness components were associated with reproduction. Survival was less variable. Stochastic simulations showed that the observed variation decreased fitness by about 30%, but the sensitivities of λ and λs to changes in all fitness components were almost equal, suggesting that temporal variation had negligible effects on selection.

While many components of avian reproduction appear to vary with parental age, the effect of age on incubation has largely been ignored so far. In this study, we tested whether young herring gulls provide a different incubation environment from mature ones and whether this has consequences for offspring performance. Laying and rearing conditions were standardised using a cross-fostering protocol. Egg predation rates tended to be higher in the nests of young parents. However, nest site, nest construction and egg temperature during incubation did not vary with parental age. Overall, the duration of incubation was shorter in young compared to mature birds and this reflected the later laying date of the former, since incubation duration generally decreased across the season. However, male eggs incubated by young parents had longer incubation periods than predicted for their laying dates. In contrast, incubation length of female eggs incubated by young pairs, and of male and female eggs incubated by mature birds did not deviate from the expected for any given laying date. Offspring that had been incubated by young parents had considerably poorer survival than those incubated by mature pairs, despite being reared under standardized, favourable conditions (singly, by mature parents). This was due to increased mortality among female chicks that had been incubated by young parents. The chicks incubated as eggs by young and mature birds, which survived until fledging, did not differ in body mass and size growth, or body condition. The results of this study demonstrate that parental age can influence offspring performance via variation in incubation environment, and that females are more susceptible than males to conditions experienced during embryonic development. © Journal of Avian Biology.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846161282

Oxidative stress plays a role in senescence-associated organ deterioration. This is supported by the beneficial effects of antioxidants against ageing-related organ damage, although their role in cardiac ageing has not been elucidated. 2. The aim of the present study was to examine the impact of cardiac-specific overexpression of catalase, an enzyme for H 2O2 detoxification, on cardiac contractile function and protein damage in young (3-4 months) and old (26-28 months) male mice. Lifespan was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Cardiomyocyte contractile indices at various stimulus frequencies (0.1-5.0 Hz) were analysed, including peak shortening (PS), time to 90% PS, time to 90% relengthening (TR 90) and maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening (±dL/dt). Protein damage was assessed using protein carbonyl formation. Catalase transgenic mice showed longer lifespan than wild-type FVB mice. The catalase transgene itself did not alter bodyweight or organ weight, or myocyte function. Ageing depressed ±dL/dt and prolonged TR90, but had no effect on other indices in FVB mice. Increased frequency triggered decreases in PS amplitude were exaggerated in aged FVB myocytes. Interestingly, ageing-induced mechanical defects were significantly attenuated in myocytes from catalase mice. Protein carbonyl formation was elevated in aged FVB compared with young FVB mice, which was significantly diminished in catalase mice. The proteomes of the myocardium of young or old FVB and catalase mice were compared using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Six proteins with differential expression between yound and old FVB groups were tentatively identified, some of which were reversed by catalase. 3.

The study spanned a period of extreme variability in winter severity (maximum winter severity indexes [WSI] of 45-195) and hunting pressure. Most studies of survival and cause-specific mortality of northern deer have assumed constant survival rates for adults of each sex (>1.0 yr old pooled) and examined fawns (0.6 ≤ x ≤ 1.0 yr old) separately. We observed U-shaped hazard (i.e., instantaneous risk of death) curves for both phases of the study, indicating that risk of death is highest for younger and older individuals. The estimated hazard for Phase II was generally lower and relatively constant for adults 2-10 years old compared to Phase I, where the instantaneous risk of death began to increase at age 6 years. This difference likely reflected differences in winter severities, associated changes in magnitude of wolf (Canis lupus) predation, and changes in hunting pressure between the 2 phases. The age distribution of our study cohort was relatively stable over the study period. Subsequently, when we included 76 neonates (i.e., ≤0.6 yr old) in the study cohort, the descending arm of the all-causes hazard began its descent at a hazard rate of 2.3 (vs. 1.0 without neonates), clearly demonstrating that the greatest risk of mortality occurs in the first year of life. We compared cumulative survival estimates for these data using the generalized Kaplan-Meier (GKM) and the iterative Nelson estimator (INE), and we illustrate the potential for bias when applying the GKM to left-truncated data. Median age of survival for females was 0.83 years old (90% CI = 0.79-1.45 yr old) using the INE and 0.43 years old (90% CI = 0.17-0.78 yr old) using the GKM. Lastly, we used a simulation approach to examine the potential for bias resulting from pooling adults. These simulations suggest that models using the constructed discrete time variable give nearly unbiased survival estimates and provide support for researchers and managers applying age-specific hazards derived during study periods to determine the reliability of adult age-pooled survival estimates. As indicated by our data, it is important to consider environmental variation and its interactions with natural mortality forces (e.g., predation) and age distribution of the population when setting harvest goals.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846818973

Both host sex and age have been found to influence immune expression and subsequently are likely factors influencing the costs of resistance. The purpose of this study was to examine immune expression and associated survival costs for two age groups (newly emerged and sexually mature individuals) of the damselfly, Enallagma boreale Selys. Survival was assessed for experimentally challenged and control damselflies, housed initially at 22°C and then subjected to low temperatures (15°C) associated with reduced foraging activity and food deprivation. Experimental conditions emulated natural local variation in bouts of good weather followed by inclement weather (successions of days with hourly mean temperatures around 15°C and/or rainy weather). Results: At least one of three immune traits was induced to higher levels for both newly emerged and mature E. boreale challenged by Lippopolysaccharide (LPS) relative to saline-injected controls, when housed at 22°C. The immune traits assayed included haemocyte concentration, Phenoloxidase activity and antibacterial activity and their induction varied among ages and between males and females. For matures, those injected with LPS had lowered survivorship compared to saline-injected controls that were housed initially at 22°C and subsequently at 15°C. Newly emerged LPS-injected damselflies did not show reduced survivorship relative to newly-emerged controls, despite showing immune induction. Conclusion: Reduced longevity following induction of immunity was observed for reproductively mature damselflies, but not for newly emerged damselflies. Costs of resistance depend only partly on the immune trait induced and more on the age (but not sex) of the host. In four years, we often observed bouts of inclement weather following good days and these bouts occurred primarily during the emergence periods, but also during the flight periods, of E. boreale. The duration of these bouts appear sufficient to compromise survival of mature damselflies that responded immunologically to LPS challenge. We further suggest the environmental conditions likely experienced by different ages of damselflies, following resistance expression, has influenced optimal immune investment by individuals in different age classes and the likelihood of detecting costs of resistance. © 2006 Robb and Forbes; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751190313

To test the ability of mothers to stimulate the immune systems of offspring, we manipulated maternal and offspring antigen exposure in a wild population of birds, pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca).

This might be because of improving breeding skills with age or because the genetic quality of young or early maternal effects on them vary with parental age. However, no attempt has been made to experimentally separate these processes in vertebrates. We conducted a cross-fostering experiment in collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) in three breeding seasons to disentangle origin- and rearing-related effects of paternal age on chick growth, while controlling for date-specific environmental conditions as well as differences in clutch and brood size. The age of the male at the nest of origin, but not that of the rearing male, had a year-dependent effect on nestling body mass and tarsus length. In two seasons, young of subadult males grew slower in the early linear phase of growth than young of adult males. There was no compensatory growth in the final asymptotic phase, so both body mass and tarsus length before fledging reflected the differential early development. In the remaining year, the age of the male at the nest of origin had no significant effect on chick growth. The environment-dependent origin effect we detected was unexplained by incubation times, hatching asynchrony, chick masses at swapping or previously described age-dependent egg quality patterns. Our results therefore suggest a genotype x environment interaction on the relative development of offspring sired by subadult and adult males. Our results also raise the possibility that female birds may gain genetic benefits by mating with older males. Further studies should identify general patterns of male age-dependent female mate choice and offspring quality in different environmental conditions. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747591421

We studied age-related changes in blue tit Parus caeruleus UV/blue structural crown coloration, a sexually selected trait. In our Austrian study population, older blue tits, irrespective of sex, displayed on average a more ultraviolet (lower hue, higher UV chroma), more chromatic and brighter crown coloration than yearlings. This age dichromatism was caused by within-individual changes in the expression of crown coloration between years since males and females became more UV, more chromatic and brighter as they aged. Colour biased survival did not contribute to the observed pattern of age dichromatism since crown coloration was largely unrelated to overwinter survival. Between-year repeatability of crown colour was significant for most colour variables but low in general, and lower for females than for males. In the blue tit, yearling males might benefit from being less ornamented by avoiding adult aggression but at the expense of sexual attractiveness. Adaptive explanations of blue tit age dichromatism should however take into account that age effects were of similar magnitude in males and females. This suggests that both male and female yearlings could benefit from being less ornamented and hence that sexual selection might be acting on both sexes simultaneously in this species. © Journal of Avian Biology.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747819803

Metallothionein mice showed a longer life span (by ∼4 mo) than FVB mice evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve.

Aging increased superoxide generation, active RhoA abundance, cytochrome c release, and p47 phox expression and suppressed aconitase activity without affecting protein nitrotyrosine formation in the hearts. These aging-induced changes in oxidative stress and related protein biomarkers were attenuated by metallothionein. Aged metallothionein mouse myocytes were more resistant to the superoxide donor pyrogallol-induced superoxide generation and apoptosis. In addition, aging-associated prolongation in TR90 was blunted by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632.

Recent studies show that short telomere length alone is insufficient to induce cellular senescence; advanced attrition of these repetitive DNA sequences does, however, reflect ageing processes. Furthermore, telomeres vary widely in length between individuals of the same age, suggesting that individuals differ in their exposure or response to telomere-shortening stress factors. Here, we show that residual telomere length predicts fitness components in two phylogenetically distant bird species: longevity in sand martins, Riparia riparia, and lifetime reproductive success in dunlins, Calidris alpina.

Interestingly, impairments in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity induce an enhancement in the expression of the quinol-oxygen alternative oxidoreductase (AOX) correlating with an extension of lifespan. This effect is thought to be determined by a reduction of the free radical generation in mitochondria. In the current investigation we have analyzed the electron transport chain composition of P. anserina and the superoxide generation rate in wild type s and in mutant grisea, a long-lived mutant with complex IV deficiency. Here we report that, similarly to other fungi, mitochondrial respiration in P. anserina is a combination of standard and alternative routes. A switch in the COX/AOX respiration balance affects the mitochondrial free radical generation. Lower mitochondrial rates of superoxide generation were found in the long-lived mutant, supporting the central role of mitochondrial free radical generation in the lifespan control of P. anserina.

We estimated the age of the host from its body mass and expected the host age-dependent pattern of flea abundance, the level of aggregation, and prevalence to be in agreement with theoretical predictions. We expected that the mean abundance and the level of aggregation of fleas would be lowest in hosts of smallest and largest size classes and highest in hosts of medium size classes, whereas pattern of variation of prevalence with host age would be either convex or asymptotic. In general, mean abundance and species richness of fleas increased with an increase in host age, although the pressure of flea parasitism in terms of number of fleas per unit host body surface decreased with host age. We found 2 clear patterns of the change in flea aggregation and prevalence with host age. The first pattern demonstrated a peak of flea aggregation and a trough of flea prevalence in animals of middle age classes (Apodemus species and C. glareolus). The second pattern was an increase of both flea aggregation and flea prevalence with host age (both Microtus species). Consequently, we did not find unequivocal evidence for the main role of either parasite-induced host mortality or acquired resistance in host age-dependent pattern of flea parasitism.

Here, the authors used the short-lived seasonal fish Nothobranchius furzeri with a maximum recorded lifespan of 13 weeks in captivity [12, 13]. Short lifespan in this species is not the result of spontaneous or targeted genetic mutations [14], but a natural trait correlated with the necessity to breed in an ephemeral habitat and tied with accelerated development and expression of ageing biomarkers at a cellular level [12, 13]. Resveratrol was added to the food starting in early adulthood and caused a dose-dependent increase of median and maximum lifespan. In addition, resveratrol delays the age-dependent decay of locomotor activity and cognitive performances and reduces the expression of neurofibrillary degeneration in the brain.

This approach requires the examination of functional relationships among traits not only in a single environment but across environments and between traits and plasticity itself. In this study, I examined the interplay of plasticity and local adaptation of offspring size in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Guppies respond to food restriction by growing and reproducing less but also by producing larger offspring. This plastic difference in offspring size is of the same order of magnitude as evolved genetic differences among populations. Larger offspring sizes are thought to have evolved as an adaptation to the competitive environment faced by newborn guppies in some environments. If plastic responses to maternal food limitation can achieve the same fitness benefit, then why has guppy offspring size evolved at all? To explore this question, I examined the plastic response to food level of females from two natural populations that experience different selective environments. My goals were to examine whether the plastic responses to food level varied between populations, test the consequences of maternal manipulation of offspring size for offspring fitness, and assess whether costs of plasticity exist that could account for the evolution of mean offspring size across populations. In each population, full-sib sisters were exposed to either a low- or high-food treatment. Females from both populations produced larger, leaner offspring in response to food limitation. However, the population that was thought to have a history of selection for larger offspring was less plastic in its investment per offspring in response to maternal mass, maternal food level, and fecundity than the population under selection for small offspring size. To test the consequences of maternal manipulation of offspring size for offspring fitness, I raised the offspring of low- and high-food mothers in either low- or high-food environments. No maternal effects were detected at high food levels, supporting the prediction that mothers should increase fecundity rather than offspring size in noncompetitive environments. For offspring raised under low food levels, maternal effects on juvenile size and male size at maturity varied significantly between populations, reflecting their initial differences in maternal manipulation of offspring size; nevertheless, in both populations, increased investment per offspring increased offspring fitness. Several correlates of plasticity in investment per offspring that could affect the evolution of offspring size in guppies were identified. Under low-food conditions, mothers from more plastic families invested more in future reproduction and less in their own soma. Similarly, offspring from more plastic families were smaller as juveniles and female offspring reproduced earlier. These correlations suggest that a fixed, high level of investment per offspring might be favored over a plastic response in a chronically low-resource environment or in an environment that selects for lower reproductive effort. © 2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

However, such effects have generally not been teased apart, and as a result their separate consequences for offspring fitness have remained unclear. 2. We tested whether young and mature Herring Gulls produce offspring of different quality due to differences in their egg-production capacity. An experimental protocol was used to standardize incubation and rearing conditions. 3. Eggs laid by young females were smaller than eggs of mature birds. They had a reduced absolute amount of albumen, which reflected mainly lower water content. 4. Within the young age class, female eggs were smaller than male eggs and had significantly paler yolk. This was due to young birds having reduced water content of the albumen, as well as carotenoid content in eggs containing a female embryo. In the mature class there were no such differences in resource allocation in relation to embryo sex. The sex ratio of clutches did not vary with parental age. 5. Hatchlings from eggs produced by young pairs were smaller skeletally but had similar mass to hatchlings from eggs laid by mature birds. When reared by mature foster parents, they did not differ in structural growth or survival. However, they showed a different pattern of growth in body mass. 6. Our results suggest that poorer reproductive performance of young breeders is not simply a consequence of poorer egg quality, as this was largely compensated for when the eggs of young pairs were incubated and reared by mature foster parents.

Here, we report known ages of individuals from a colony of Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) based on recaptures of leg-banded birds, including two individuals that were at least 44 years of age, the oldest Great Frigatebirds ever reported. Using a previously developed molecular technique, we report a predictable, nonlinear decline of TRF length with age in this population. Telomere restriction fragments decline more rapidly early in life but continue to shorten throughout the life span examined. The rate of decline in TRF for this species does not fit the tight correlation previously reported between TROC and life span in other species. Finally, we tested the ability to estimate age and age structure of breeding females on the basis of the calibration of TRF length and individuals of known age. Because of the slow telomere-attrition rate and the variability observed in TRF lengths at given ages, estimations of age of individuals and of estimated age structure of breeding birds in this population are not particularly reliable. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2006.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746308678

RT-qPCR analysis found that K-ras4B expression was reduced in K-rastmΔ4A/tmΔ4A ES cells but unaffected in small intestine. K-Ras deficiency did not affect ES cell growth, and K-Ras4A deficiency did not affect intestinal epithelial proliferation. K-rastmΔ4A/tmΔ4A and K-ras-/- ES cells showed a reduced capacity for differentiation following LIF withdrawal, and K-ras-/- cells were least differentiated. K-Ras4A deficiency inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis in ES cells and intestinal epithelial cells. However, K-rastmΔ4A/tmΔ4A ES cells were more resistant to etoposide-induced apoptosis than K-ras-/- cells. The results indicate that (1) K-Ras4A promotes apoptosis while K-Ras4B inhibits it, and (2) K-Ras4B, and possibly K-Ras4A, promotes differentiation. The findings raise the possibility that alteration of the K-Ras4A/4B isoform ratio modulates tumorigenesis by differentially affecting stem cell survival and/or differentiation. However, K-Ras4A deficiency did not affect life expectancy or spontaneous overall tumor incidence in aging mice. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have shown that chick growth and fledging success vary with age of the parental pair and with laying date, with older parents and those nesting earlier being more successful. This study investigated the dependence of breeding performance and one aspect of behavior, defense against conspecifics, on age and laying date. Nest defense behavior was evaluated by recording individual responses to a mirror placed 20 cm from the nest, simulating an unfamiliar intruder within the territory. Most study birds were of known age (3-21 years) from banding as chicks; they were divided into three groups: ≥12, 8-11 and ≤seven years. Responses to the mirror were examined during incubation and at the time of hatching. Older birds nested earlier than younger birds. Chicks reared by older parents gained mass more quickly and survived better than chicks of younger parents. Using a composite score reflecting both the intensity and duration of aggressive responses to the mirror, older birds responded more strongly than younger birds during incubation, but responses were similar at the time of hatching. Older birds reduced their aggressive responses between incubation and hatching, while younger birds increased their responses. We suggest that this contributes to the greater success of older birds, because younger birds expend more time and energy on territorial defense at a time when they need to feed chicks. Our findings are consistent with previous studies and show that Common Tern colonies are finely structured by age and laying date; older and earlier-nesting birds are superior to younger and later birds on several measures of performance. This study suggests that finely-tuned nest defense behavior is one component of the superior performance of old birds. © Springer 2006.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745641915

Although aging in most mammals is accompanied by dental senescence due to advanced wear, primates have low-crowned teeth that wear down before old age. Because tooth wear alters crown features gradually, testing whether early dental senescence causes reproductive senescence has been difficult. To identify whether and when low-crowned teeth compromise reproductive success, we used a 20-year field study of Propithecus edwardsi, a rainforest lemur from Madagascar with a maximum lifespan of >27 years. We analyzed tooth wear in three dimensions with dental topographic analysis by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology. We report that tooth wear exposes compensatory shearing blades that maintain dental function for 18 years. Beyond this age, female fertility remains high; however infants survive only if lactation seasons have elevated rainfall. Therefore, low-crowned teeth accommodate wear to a point, after which reproductive success closely tracks environmental fluctuations. These results suggest a tooth wear-determined, but rainfall-mediated, onset of reproductive senescence. Additionally, our study indicates that even subtle changes in climate may affect reproductive success of rainforest species. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-28044464716

The order Lagomorpha consists of two families; Leporidae and Ochotonidae. We examined telomere biology in species representing three leporid genera (European White Rabbit, Black-tailed Jack Rabbit, and Swamp Rabbit) and the monotypic ochotonid genus (North American Pika). Of the leporids one species was a laboratory strain and the others were wild caught. The leporids neither exhibited cellular senescence after sustained periods in culture nor displayed detectable telomerase activity. Continued culture was possible because of their extremely long telomeric arrays. Immunofluorescence showed robust telomere signals at chromosome ends and significant internal chromosomal staining in some instances. Pika was unique in displaying endogenous telomerase activity throughout time in culture. These results show that it is unlikely that lagomorphs use telomere shortening and replicative senescence as a tumor protective mechanism. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We sought, therefore, to find out if mice, receiving dietary Echinacea daily, throughout life, from youth until late middle-age, demonstrated any longevity/survival differences, and/or any differences in their various populations of immune/hemopoietic cells. Sustained and/or high levels of these cells are crucial for longevity. Some mice were maintained on a regular chow diet to which was added Echinacea purpurea daily (2 mg/mouse), from puberty (7 week) until just beyond 13 months of age (late middle-age in mice). Control mice, identically housed and maintained, received identical chow without the herb. Mice consuming untreated diet had a 79% survival by 10 months of age, while those consuming Echinacea daily in the diet were still 100% alive by 10 months. At approximately 13 months of age, mice consuming untreated diet had a 46% survival rate while those consuming Echinacea, were 74% alive at this time. Moreover, the key immune cells, acting as the first line of defense against developing neoplasms in mice and humans, i.e., natural killer (NK) cells, were significantly elevated in absolute number both in their bone marrow production site, as well as in the major organ to which they traffic and function, i.e., the spleen. The cells of the myeloid/granulocyte lineages remained steadfastly at control levels in both the bone marrow and spleen in Echinacea consuming mice. Thus, it appears that regular intake of Echinacea may indeed be beneficial/prophylactic, if only for the reason that it maintains in an elevated state, NK cells, prime elements in immunosurveillance against spontaneous-developing tumors, a phenomenon which increases in frequency with progressive aging. © Springer 2005.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23644444278

Here, we investigated whether a lack of BDNF in early postnatal BDNF-/- mice or a chronic 50% reduction in BDNF levels in aging BDNF+/- mice would affect the survival of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. In general terms, BDNF-/- and BDNF+/- mice had morphologically and quantitatively normal nigrostriatal neurons at any time between postnatal day 14 (P14) and 18 months, when compared to their wild-type littermates. BDNF-/- mice (P14 and P21 only) had fewer dopaminergic dendrites in the substantia nigra, suggesting that BDNF plays a role in phenotypic maturation, but not in neuronal birth or survival. BDNF-/- mice also had aberrant tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cell bodies in the pars reticulata. During adulthood and aging, BDNF+/- mice performed equally well as their wild-type littermates in tests of motor coordination, and both showed aging-related decreases in the size of the dopaminergic neurons as well as in motor coordination.

We studied a large, stable population of Kentish Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus) breeding in southern Turkey (36°43'N, 35°03'E) for five breeding seasons (1996-2000). Kentish Plovers of Eurasia and the conspecific Snowy Plover of North America are a species of conservation concern. We captured 2077 birds, and used time since marking models to estimate apparent survival (φ) and encounter rates (p) for juvenile and adult plovers. Return rates of young banded in their natal year were low (4%, 52 of 1176) and most philopatric young were recaptured as yearlings (69%, 36 of 52). Low return rates of shorebird young can be attributed to post-hatching mortality if apparent survival rates are ranked: chicks &lt; fledglings = adults. We were unable to separate mortality from dispersal because apparent survival was ranked: chicks (φ1 = 0.08) &lt; fledglings (φ1 = 0.15) &lt; adults after banding (φ1 = 0.59) &lt; adults in later intervals (φ2+ = 0.64). Time since marking models gave improved estimates of the apparent survival of adults that were higher than return rates in other populations of Kentish Plovers, but lower than estimates of apparent survival for other Charadrius plovers. Sex-biased mating opportunities in Kentish Plovers were not explained by biased sex ratios at hatching or differential apparent survival among adults. Instead, male-biased adult sex ratios were explained, in part, by differential survival of juveniles and by higher encounter rates among adult males (p̂ = 0.84) than females (p̂ = 0.74).

Nest survival likely varies with nest age and date, but until recently researchers had only limited tools to efficiently address those sources of variability. Beginning with Mayfield (1961), many researchers have averaged survival rates within time-specific categories (e.g. egg and nestling stages; early and late nesting dates). However, Mayfield's estimator assumes constant survival within categories, and violations of that assumption can lead to biased estimates. We used the logistic-exposure method to examine nest survival as a function of nest age and date in Clay-colored Sparrows (Spizella pallida) and Vesper Sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) breeding in north-central North Dakota. Daily survival rates increased during egg laying, decreased during incubation to a low shortly after hatch, and then increased during brood rearing in both species. Variation in survival with nest age suggests that traditional categorical averaging using Mayfield's or similar methods would have been inappropriate for this study; similar variation may bias results of other studies. Nest survival also varied with date. For both species, survival was high during the peak of nest initiations in late May and early June and declined throughout the remainder of the nesting season. On the basis of our results, we encourage researchers to consider models of nest survival that involve continuous time-specific explanatory variables (e.g. nest age or date). We also encourage researchers to document nest age as precisely as possible (e.g. by candling eggs) to facilitate age-specific analyses. Models of nest survival that incorporate time-specific information may provide insights that are unavailable from averaged data.

Significant overlap between indirect telomerase regulation pathways and cell cycle checkpoint pathways exist, suggesting that these discrete genetic elements (namely, p21, p53, and hTERT) synergistically cooperate to inhibit tumorigenesis. Mutations in these pathways have been known to contribute to cancer formation. However, the incorporation of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms provides another line of defense against these negative occurrences. These proteins are also implicated in the process of senescence, caused in eukaryotic cell lines by telomere shortening. Although the debate continues, there is significant evidence to classify the process of cellular senescence as an in vitro model for human aging. In addition, the study of stem cells gives information about the down-regulation of hTERT in the aging process. Diseases such as Werner's syndrome, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase), DKC (dyskeratosis congenita), and atherosclerosis have been linked to aberrant telomerase expression and other aging-related tissue malfunctions could be related to the presence of senescent cells changing the cellular microenvironment. Therefore, restoring telomerase activity as a putative therapeutic strategy necessitates further study to elucidate the intricacies linking genetic and epigenetic modulations of hTERT.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17244369732

Mammalian life histories can be ordered along a slow-fast continuum from slow-developing, long-lived species with low reproductive rates at one end to rapidly developing, short-lived species with high reproductive rates at the other. Body size and mortality rate are strong correlates of the slow-fast axis, whereby juvenile and adult mortality rates correlate positively but are linked to certain life-history traits with differing strengths. The strong covariation of life-history traits renders it difficult to evaluate the adaptive value of single life-history elements. Species that deviate from the common pattern might help to identify specific selected strategies. 2. Caviomorph rodents show an unusual combination of life-history traits. Like slow-living mammals, they produce few precocial young after long gestation periods, but they have the early maturation potential of their fast-living counterparts. This combination of life-history traits suggests low levels of juvenile mortality but high adult mortality rates, and thus an unusually low ratio of juvenile to adult mortality compared to other small mammals. To test these predictions, we modelled age-specific survival probabilities using capture-recapture data from a wild population of Cavia magna. 3. Patterns of age-specific survival rates were in accordance with the predictions, but atypical for small mammals. Levels of adult survival were low, and comparable to those of much smaller rodent species. Juvenile survival probabilities were high relative to those reported for other small mammals and reached adult levels after only 1 month. The ratio of adult to early juvenile survival depended strongly on the date of birth. Whereas survival of young from the first birth cohort in spring did not differ from that of adults, early survivorship of later cohorts was lower. 4. Our results fit expectations from life-history theory and suggest that high levels of adult mortality selected for the early onset of reproduction in wild cavies. The comparatively low juvenile mortalities are probably a consequence of the precocial state of the cavy offspring. We suggest that the reproductive strategy of cavies represents a different solution to the trade-off between fecundity and juvenile survival compared to altricial small mammals.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-13844273242

Individual snakes maintained similar among-year parasite loads. Hepatozoon infections affected python growth rate, i.e. snakes suffering from high infection levels exhibited significantly slower growth compared to individuals with low parasite loads. Our results suggest that the parasites also affected the pythons' nutritional status (condition), as snakes with low condition scores suffered from higher parasite infection levels than snakes with high scores. Furthermore, our data suggest that parasitaemia may affect female reproductive output, as reproductive female pythons harboured lower parasite loads compared to non-reproductive adult females. High levels of parasite infections also affected juvenile python survival, as recaptured snakes harboured significantly lower parasite loads compared to non-recaptured yearling pythons. In our study area, water python have very few natural predators and, hence, experience low mortality rates and commonly reach an age of > 15 years. In contrast to results obtained in other studies, parasite loads in larger/ older pythons were lower compared to younger snakes, suggesting that only snakes harbouring lower levels of parasitaemia were able to survive to old age. We suggest that a possible cause for the opposing results regarding parasite prevalence and host age may be due to different levels of extrinsic mortality rates and longevity.

Only the arrival date and the clutch size were significantly different between the groups of males but other breeding features were very similar. These results may be explained by a short life-span of flycatchers and by conditions in the Białowieża National Park. A surplus of good natural cavities reduced competition between young and old males, and a surplus of food could reduce differences in foraging abilities.

However, among adults, telomere length is not related to age. This is consistent with reports of most telomere loss occurring early in life in other vertebrates. Thus, caution must be used in estimating annual rates of telomere loss, as these are probably not constant with age. We also measured changes within individuals in the wild, using repeat samples taken from individual shags as chicks and adults. We found high inter-individual variation in the magnitude of telomere loss, much of which was explained by circumstances during growth. Individuals laying down high tissue mass for their size showed greater telomere shortening. Independently of this, individuals born late in the season showed more telomere loss.

This identity permits the construction of life tables from data where the birth date of subjects is unknown. An analogous key identity is established for the continuous case in which the survival schedule of the wild population is related to the density of the survival distribution in the marked cohort. These identities are explored for both life tables and continuous lifetime data. For the continuous case, they are implemented with statistical methods using non-parametric density estimation methods to obtain flexible estimates for the unknown survival distribution of the wild population. The analytical model provided here serves as a starting point to develop more complex models for residual demography, i.e. models for estimating survival of wild populations in which age-at-entry is unknown and using remaining information in randomly encountered individuals.

Because selection is generally weaker late in life, genes or traits that improve early-life performance but impair late-life performance should come to predominate. Variation in the strength of age-specific selection should then generate adaptive variation in senescence. We demonstrate this mechanism by comparing early and late breeders within a population of semelparous capital-breeding sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). We show that early breeders (but not late breeders) are under strong selection for a long reproductive lifespan (RLS), which facilitates defence of their nests against disturbance by later females. Accordingly, early females invest less energy in egg production while reserving more for nest defence. Variation along this reproductive trade-off causes delayed or slower senescence in early females (average RLS of 26 days) than in late females (reproductive lifespan of 12 days). We use microsatellites to confirm that gene flow is sufficiently limited between early and late breeders to allow adaptive divergence in response to selection.

Results: Our results clearly demonstrated an age effect on reproductive performance for both males and females: young breeders were less likely to fledge young.

This includes strong male biased harvesting, which over the last decade has resulted in a change in the sex and age composition of the populations. During the same period of time, a reduction in the proportion of male calves in the harvest has occurred all over Norway, probably reflecting a change in the secondary sex ratio. In order to examine for any causal link between these two patterns, we manipulated the structural composition of an isolated island population of moose in northern Norway and at the same time closely monitored the variation in the secondary sex ratio. In the first stage of the project, which was assumed to represent the conditions in a natural, unhunted moose population, the proportion of male calves increased significantly with the age of their fathers. Potentially, as a consequence of the high mean adult male age in the population, the secondary sex ratio was highly male biased. When we altered the male segment of the population, leaving only young (≤ 21/2 years old) males as potential mates for the females, a significant increase in the proportion of female calves occurred in the population. Finally, in the last 3-years stage of the project, we reduced the adult sex ratio in the population to about 23% males and kept the adult male age relatively high. This again led to an increasing secondary sex ratio. These results suggest that the age composition of males in the population may affect the secondary sex ratio. The general significance of these results was supported by a larger temporal decrease in the proportion of males that were shot in the areas of Norway with larger changes in the sex composition of the hunting quotas than in the regions in which a less extreme harvest strategy were practised.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842561661

Because aging nests typically requires handling the eggs, there may be situations where nests can not or should not be aged and the Stanley (2000) model will be inapplicable.

The Bayesian method also lets the biologist look for high- and low-survival rates during the whole nesting period. In practice, it is common for data of several types to be collected in a single study. That is, some nests may be aged, others are not.

Adults are partially protected by venom resistance and harass rattlesnakes in part to defend their more vulnerable offspring. Larger, warmer snakes are more dangerous than smaller colder snakes, and in escalated conflict squirrels could benefit from risk assessment strategies. Rattlesnakes often rattle at harassing squirrels and rattling sounds produce cues related to body size and temperature. In study 1 we played back rattling sounds from snakes that varied in dangerousness and evaluated the roles of sex and parity in squirrel risk assessment strategies. In general, squirrels tail flagged and stood bipedally more, and were slower to reapproach the playback speaker following playbacks of rattling sounds from more dangerous snakes. In comparison with males and nonmothers, mothers were most responsive to rattling sounds and more sensitive to variation in snake dangerousness. Mothers tail flagged more than males and nonmothers, and this behavior tracked variation in snake dangerousness most closely, perhaps reflecting the effects of snake size and temperature on pup vulnerability. These findings suggest that many aspects of squirrel antisnake behavior are governed by their effects on descendant kin. In study 2 we tested the effects of offspring age on mothers' responses to live rattlesnakes and rattling sounds. According to the offspring value hypothesis, mothers should take more risks in defense of older offspring because they are more likely to survive to reproductive age. By contrast, under the offspring vulnerability hypothesis, older offspring are less vulnerable to predators and thus mothers should take fewer risks. Risk-taking, as measured by behaviors that bring the squirrel close to the snake's strike range, was either unaffected by or negatively correlated with offspring age. Thus, our findings suggest that whereas offspring value is unimportant in squirrel antisnake behavior, offspring vulnerability may affect maternal defense. We suggest that offspring vulnerability in mammals, in comparison with birds, may play a larger role in parental defense against predators.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242658510

Therefore, telomere may be an indicator of the mitotic history of a cell and it is also a determining factor for the residual cell life span. One mechanism, compensating for the telomere erosion, involves the induction of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein-enzyme able to synthesize telomeric DNA repeats. In this study, old subjects of two consecutive decades were compared with a group of young controls to investigate whether ageing-related modifications differently affects telomere length and telomerase activity of human peripheral blood CD8 T and CD16 NK lymphocytes. Telomeres in individual cells were measured by flow-FISH and telomerase activity was determined using the TeloTAGGG telomerase PCR ELISAPLUS kit. Both CD8 T and NK lymphocytes showed an age-associated loss of telomeres at rates that were different between the subsets together with an age-associated reduction of telomerase activity that was progressive in CD8 and late in NK lymphocytes. We can assume that preserved innate immune response in the elderly is due to the negligible telomere shortening and the maintained telomerase expression that could allow NK cells of octogenarians to delay replicative senescence. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Hypertension in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients is associated with more rapid progression of renal disease and a high incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The present study was undertaken to examine the role of parental hypertension in the occurrence of hypertension in 475 ADPKD offspring. Methods. Adult subjects participating in an ongoing study of the natural history of ADPKD were included in the analysis if they were diagnosed with ADPKD, had a known affected parent, and knew the hypertensive status of both parents. Results. When the affected parent was hypertensive, the ADPKD male (82% versus 62%, P < 0.05) and female (61% versus 37%, P < 0.005) offspring had a significantly higher frequency of hypertension than when the ADPKD-affected parent was normotensive. The median age of diagnosis of hypertension was also significantly earlier in both male (33 years versus 40 years, P < 0.05) and female (38 years versus 50 years, P < 0.05) ADPKD patients when their affected parents were hypertensive as compared with normotensive. These effects of hypertension in the affected parent on hypertension in the ADPKD offspring were independent of age, renal volume, and renal function in the offspring. Hypertension in unaffected parents also increased the frequency of hypertension in the ADPKD female (69% versus 53%, P < 0.01), but not male (89% versus 77%, NS) subjects. Conclusion. The results indicate that parental hypertension influences the frequency of hypertension in ADPKD patients.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142218066

However, optimal female body size also depends on how natural selection acts during other parts of the life cycle. Larger female Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) produce larger eggs than do smaller females, and ducklings from larger eggs survive better than those hatching from smaller eggs. Accordingly, we examined patterns of apparent annual survival for female scaup and tested whether natural selection on female body size primarily was stabilizing, a frequent assumption in studies of sexually dimorphic species in which males are the larger sex, or was directional, counter-acting reproductive advantages of large size. We estimated survival using mark-recapture methods for individually marked females from two study sites in Canada (Erickson, Manitoba; St. Denis, Saskatchewan). Structurally larger (adults) and heavier (ducklings) females had lower survival than did smaller individuals in Manitoba; no relationship was detected in adults from Saskatchewan. Survival of adult females declined with indices of increasing reproductive effort at both sites; consequently, the cost of reproduction could explain age-related patterns of breeding propensity in scaup. Furthermore, if larger females are more likely to breed than are smaller females, then cost of reproduction also may help explain why survival was lower for larger females. Overall, we found that advantages of large body size of female scaup during breeding or as young ducklings apparently were counteracted by natural selection favoring lightweight juveniles and structurally smaller adult females through higher annual survival.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038033020

Methods and Results One hundred and thirty-five consecutive ASD-patients, operated on in childhood, were studied longitudinally with ECG, echocardiography, exercise testing and Holter-recording 15 (10-22) and 26 (21-33) years after surgery. During follow-up no cardiovascular mortality, stroke, heart failure and no pulmonary hypertension occurred. Symptomatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were present in 6% after 15 years, and an additional 2% occurred in the last decade; 5% needed pacemaker implantation. No relation was found between arrhythmias and type of ASD, baseline data, right ventricular dimensions, or age at operation. Left and right ventricular function and dimension, remained unchanged. Slightly more patients had right atrial dilatation at last follow-up. Exercise capacity was comparable with the normal Dutch population. Conclusions The long-term outcome after ASD closure at young age shows excellent survival and low morbidity.

Initial square spacings ranged from 2 to 6 m; treatment plots were 0.4 ha in size and were replicated three times (six times for the 3 m spacing). Permanent measurement plots were installed at age 8, and the lower portion of all stems was pruned in the loth growing season to reduce blister rust infections. The plots were remeasured at ages 11 and 16. Sixteen years after planting, survival averaged 80%; most mortality was associated with blister rust, but the rate of new infections and mortality diminished substantially between ages 11 and 16; 71% of the planted trees were free of blister rust at age 16.

Using a well characterized model system for breast cancer, we define here the molecular and cellular consequences of adriamycin treatment in breast tumor cells. Cells acutely exposed to adriamycin exhibited an increase in p53 activity, a decline in telomerase activity, and a dramatic increase in β-galactosidase, a marker of senescence. Inactivation of wild-type p53 resulted in a transition of the cellular response to adriamycin treatment from replicative senescence to delayed apoptosis, demonstrating that p53 plays an integral role in the fate of breast tumor cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Stable introduction of hTERT, the catalytic protein component of telomerase, into MCF-7 cells caused an increase in telomerase activity and telomere length. Treatment of MCF-7-hTERT cells with adriamycin produced an identical senescence response as controls without signs of telomere shortening, indicating that the senescence after treatment is telomere length-independent. However, we found that exposure to adriamycin resulted in an overrepresentation of cytogenetic changes involving telomeres, showing an altered telomere state induced by adriamycin is probably a causal factor leading to the senescence phenotype.

We describe a method to reversibly bypass replicative senescence and generate mass cultures that have different average telomere lengths. A retrovirus carrying hTERT flanked by excision sites for Cre recombinase rendered normal human fibroblasts telomerase-positive and replicatively immortal. Superinfection with retro-viruses carrying wild-type or mutant forms of TIN2, a negative regulator of telomere length, created telomerase-positive, immortal populations with varying average telomere lengths. Subsequent infection with a Cre-expressing retrovirus abolished telomerase activity, creating mortal cells with varying telomere lengths. Using these cell populations, we show that, after hTERT excision, cells senesce with shorter telomeres than parental cells. Moreover, long telomeres, but not telomerase, protected cells from the loss of division potential caused by ionizing radiation. Finally, although telomerase-negative cells with short telomeres senesced after fewer doublings than those with long telomeres, telomere length per se did not correlate with senescence. Our results support a role for telomere structure, rather than length, in replicative senescence.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037047298

This study investigates the cellular functions performed by the polymerase domain of Pol2p and its role in DNA metabolism. The pol2-16 mutation has a deletion in the catalytic domain of DNA polymerase ε that eliminates its polymerase and exonuclease activities. It is a viable mutant, which displays temperature sensitivity for growth and a defect in elongation step of chromosomal DNA replication even at permissive temperatures. This mutation is synthetic lethal in combination with temperature-sensitive mutants or the 3′- to 5′-exonuclease-deficient mutant of DNA polymerase δ in a haploid cell. These results suggest that the catalytic activity of DNA polymerase ε participates in the same pathway as DNA polymerase δ, and this is consistent with the observation that DNA polymerases δ and ε colocalize in some punctate foci on yeast chromatids during S phase.

Annual survival rates averaged 0.89 but varied among years between 0.82 and 0.93, with annual variations being temporally associated with variations in sandeel abundance during the breeding season. Most birds appeared to die outside the breeding season and so it is possible that nutritional stress and reproductive costs of breeding in years of poor food supply affect survivorship on migration or in the wintering range. Survival rates of adult Great Skuas were affected by their age according to a quadratic equation, with survival increasing significantly with age from 0.73 in 5-year-old-birds to between 0.85 and 0.96 in birds from 7 to 22 years old, with a sharp decline to between 0.75 and 0.87 in birds over 22 years old.

Keratinocytes engineered to express hTERT maintain long telomeres but typically are not immortalized unless, by mutation or other heritable event, they avoid or greatly reduce p16 expression. We have confirmed that keratinocytes undergo p16-related senescence during growth in culture, whether in the fibroblast feeder cell system or in the specialized K-sfm medium formulation, and that this mechanism can act as a barrier to immortalization following hTERT expression. We have characterized the p16-related arrest mechanism more precisely by interfering specifically with several regulators of cell cycle control. Epidermal, oral mucosal, corneal limbal, and conjunctival keratinocytes were transduced to express a p16-insensitive mutant cdk4 (cdk4R24C), to abolish p16 control, and/or a dominant negative mutant p53 (p53DD), to abolish p53 function. Expression of either cdk4R24C or p53DD alone had little effect on life span, but expression of both permitted cells to divide 25 to 43 population doublings (PD) beyond their normal limit. Keratinocytes from a p16+/- individual transduced to express p53DD alone displayed a 31-PD life span extension associated with selective growth of variants that had lost the wild-type p16 allele. Cells in which both p53 and p16 were nonfunctional divided rapidly during their extended life span but experienced telomere erosion and ultimately ceased growth with very short telomeres. Expression of hTERT in these cells immortalized them. Keratinocytes engineered to express cdk4R24C and hTERT but not p53DD did not exhibit an extended life span. Rare immortal variants exhibiting p53 pathway defects arose from them, however, indicating that the p53-dependent component of keratinocyte senescence is telomere independent. Mutational loss of p16 and p53 has been found to be a frequent early event in the development of squamous cell carcinoma.

In contrast, recaptures-only models confounded emigration with mortality.

We found no evidence of temporal variation age of first breeding of birds from different cohorts. There was significant temporal variation in the annual survival of adults and the survival over the typical 3-year maturation period of prebreeding birds, with extremely low values for both groups from the 1991 breeding season. The estimated overwinter survival rate (0.62) for adults from 1991-1992 was about three-quarters the usual rate of about 0.83, but the low survival of fledglings from 1991 resulted in less than 25% of the otherwise expected number of young from that cohort returning as breeding birds; this suggests that fledglings suffered a greater proportional decrease in survival than did adults. The survival estimates of young from 1989 and 1990 show that these cohorts were not negatively influenced by the events that decimated the young from 1991, and the young from 1992 and 1993 had above-average survival estimates.

Although senescent declines in survival are well documented in humans and in domestic and laboratory animals, evidence for their occurrence and importance in wild animal species remains limited and equivocal. Several recent papers have suggested that methodological issues may contribute to this problem, and have encouraged investigators to improve sampling designs and to analyse their data using recently developed approaches to modelling of capture-mark-recapture data. Here we report on a three-year, two-site, mark-recapture study of known-aged common terns (Sterna hirundo) in the north-eastern USA. The study was nested within a long-term ecological study in which large numbers of chicks had been banded in each year for > 25 years. We used a range of models to test the hypothesis of an influence of age on survival probability. We also tested for a possible influence of sex on survival. The cross-sectional design of the study (one year's parameter estimates) avoided the possible confounding of effects of age and time. The study was conducted at a time when one of the study sites was being colonized and numbers were increasing rapidly. We detected two-way movements between the sites and estimated movement probabilities in the year for which they could be modelled. We also obtained limited data on emigration from our study area to more distant sites. We found no evidence that survival depended on either sex or age, except that survival was lower among the youngest birds (ages 2-3 years). Despite the large number of birds included in the study (1599 known-aged birds, 2367 total), confidence limits on estimates of survival probability were wide, especially for the oldest age-classes, so that a slight decline in survival late in life could not have been detected. In addition, the cross-sectional design of this study meant that a decline in survival probability within individuals (actuarial senescence) could have been masked by heterogeneity in survival probability among individuals (mortality selection). This emphasizes the need for the development of modelling tools permitting separation of these two phenomena, valid under field conditions in which the recapture probabilities are less than one.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036148070

Since young Shags breed relatively late in the season, and lay smaller eggs, we used a cross-fostering procedure to control for environmental and egg quality effects on chick louse loads. We found that, independent of breeding period and whether the chicks hatched from eggs laid by young or older birds, broods raised by young pairs carried a significantly higher louse load than those raised by older pairs. In our data set, we could not detect an effect of louse load on offspring growth and survival when controlling for parental age in the statistical analysis. However, to examine this fully, an experimental manipulation would be required to break the otherwise close relationship between parental age and louse numbers.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035716005

I experimentally investigated the effects of territory quality versus other age-related improvements in breeding competence (e.g. foraging skills, breeding experience and local knowledge) on age-specific reproductive success. Territory quality (i.e. territory field layer height) was manipulated in year 2 of northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) that were breeding in the same territory in two consecutive years. Changing territory quality by changing field layer height had a strong effect on within-individual change in the reproductive success of wheatears. This effect was mainly due to a corresponding change in nest predation risk. When territory quality was kept constant (i.e. no between-year change in territory field layer height), within-individual reproductive success did not change between subsequent years. Thus, age-related improvements in foraging skills, breeding experience and local familiarity had no significant effect on within-individual changes in reproductive success. Increased reproductive success with increased age in northern wheatears is therefore mainly explained by an improved access to high-quality territories with increasing age.

Many studies of cooperatively breeding birds have found no effect of group size on reproductive success, contrary to predictions of most adaptive hypotheses. A model is proposed for variation in group-size effects: group size has a reduced effect on success when conditions for breeding are good, such as in good environmental conditions or in groups with older breeders. This hypothesis is tested with a case study of white-browed scrubwrens Sericornis frontalis and a review of the literature. 2. The scrubwren is a cooperatively breeding passerine with male helpers. Previous analyses revealed no effect of group size on reproductive success, but those analyses were restricted to groups with older females (Magrath & Yezerinac 1997). Here 7 years' data are used to contrast the effect of group size on reproductive success for yearling and older females. 3. Yearling females breeding in groups had more than double the seasonal reproductive success than those breeding in pairs, even after controlling for territory quality. However, group size still had no effect on the reproductive success of older females. Yearling females tended to survive better in groups, but older females tended to survive better in pairs, emphasizing this pattern. 4. Yearlings breeding in pairs were more likely to be found on poor-quality territories than those breeding in groups, exaggerating the already-strong effect of group size on yearling success. Older females were not affected significantly by territory quality. 5. Group size, territory quality and female age affected different components of seasonal reproductive success. Group size increased the success of individual nesting attempts, while both territory quality and female age affected the length of the breeding season, and thus the number of breeding attempts. 6. A sample of the literature on cooperative breeders shows that group size has a larger effect on reproductive success in poorer conditions, caused either by younger, inexperienced breeders or poorer environmental conditions. Scrubwrens therefore illustrate a widespread pattern, which provides an explanation for much of the variation in group-size effects among and within species. Clearly single estimates of group-size effects for species can be inadequate to test ideas about the evolution of cooperative breeding.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035015928

However, a range of survival times exists, and parameters that define prognostic groups may help to optimize treatment.

Similar to other studies, we found no association of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression (as assessed by immunohistochemistry), p53 immunopositivity, or p53 mutation with survival in the entire sample. However, EGFR overexpression showed trends toward worse prognosis in patients younger than the median age, but better prognosis in patients older than the median age. This interaction of EGFR with age group was statistically significant and led us to focus our further analyses on the younger patients. In this group, a statistically significant association of EGFR overexpression with worse survival was identified in the p53-negative but not p53-positive tumors. We found a similar result after screening these cases for mutations in p53: EGFR overexpression was negatively associated with survival only in the p53 wild-type cases. To confirm this unexpected result, this finding was reproduced in a validation sample of an additional 42 tumors from younger patients on the same two clinical protocols. This complex relationship between EGFR and p53 in younger patients remained in a multivariate analysis that incorporated additional prognostic variables. The results suggest that analysis of prognostic markers in GBM is complex, and maximal information may require analysis of subgroups based on age and the status of specific markers such as p53.

We describe the occurence of age-assortative breeding in the Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) near Wuxi, China. Throughout the whole breeding season, 59% of the breeders were adults i.e., birds older than two years, and 41% were younger birds in juvenile plumage i.e., birds in their second year. Most of 206 pairs were strictly assorted by age, and only 2.4% had one adult and one juvenile. A part of this assortment was due to age-related differences in the breeding period, but even when this seasonality is accounted for, the observed frequency of mixed pairs is much lower than expected. Mate fidelity is not likely to account for the observed assortment. We conclude that the strict age assortment we observed in Black-crowned Night Herons is to be ascribed to active mate selection by age. Reproductive success was higher for pairs of adults than for those in juvenile plumage, while no difference was found for egg size, chick condition or asymmetry. Pairing between adults may therefore be adaptive because it enhances reproductive success. The high frequency of Black-crowned Night Herons breeding in juvenile plumage in China (41%) contrasts sharply with the situation in other parts of the species range, where birds in juvenile plumage rarely breed, are even seldom seen near colonies, and are believed to remain in their wintering areas.

Survivorship was estimated with nonlinear regression analysis using bootstrapping to obtain estimates of errors. Initial recapture success of the younger cohort was greater than the older cohort at both locations. Our analysis revealed a significantly greater survival rate for the younger cohort of females in Puerto Rico, and no significant differences between age cohorts in Thailand. For comparison, a traditional approach for analyzing these type of data, linear regression of log-transformed captures over time (exponential model), was used to calculate the probability of daily survival based on slopes of linear regression lines for recaptured mosquitoes. With this method, the estimated daily survival rate of older females (13-23 d old) was significantly greater than survival of younger ones (3-13 d old) in Puerto Rico and Thailand. In addition, short-range movement of mosquitoes was observed in Puerto Rico; maximum dispersal distance detected was 79 m.

For both males and females, conspecific reproductive success was the most important covariate explaining the interannual variation in age of recruitment; colony size was also important for females. These covariates explained nearly 60% of the year-to-year variation for both sexes. The age of recruitment increased for cohorts born after 1990, and this increase was correlated with a decline in breeding success in the colony; we interpret this as an indirect and delayed density-dependent effect. Females were recruited earlier than males (mean age of recruitment for cohorts born before 1990: 2.98 years versus 3.53 years); the most plausible reason for this is a skewed sex ratio in favour of males in the adult population.

I also found a genetic basis for differences between populations in the age at which males attain maturity and in growth rates. By rearing fish in four different common environments, I tested for phenotypic plasticity in male life-history traits in response to nonlethal exposure to predators. There was a significant delay in the onset of sexual maturity in fish exposed to predators relative to those in the control, but no differences among treatments in size at maturity or growth rates. These results, coupled with previous work on B. rhabdophora, demonstrate a repeated pattern of parallel evolutionary divergence among genetically isolated populations that is strongly associated with predation.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034893568

When the defect is paternal in origin, it often can be shown that the primary lesion arose during mitotic proliferation of the spermatogonial germ cell population. By contrast, germline mosaicism is seldom invoked to explain the age dependency of maternally derived aberrations because germline proliferation in the ovary is already completed during fetal development. Age-dependent defects of maternal origin might, however, be explained in part by the progressive loss of oocytes during the mother's reproductive life. A large number of oocytes undergo the initial stages of maturation each month, but typically only one completes maturation and is ovulated while the majority are discarded, probably by an apoptotic mechanism. Here we explore the possibility that the monthly choice of oocytes to undergo maturation is influenced by subtle phenotypic characters of those oocytes that may bear genetic defects such as trisomy 21. We have generated a mathematical model to describe the loss kinetics for such mutant oocytes relative to the overall pool of resting oocytes, and we assess evolutionary strategies that would favor their utilization faster than, at the same rate as, or slower than the normal oocytes. This formulation reveals that the slower-rate scheme would effectively diminish the utilization of mutant oocytes in young mothers but would increase the risk of related birth defects for older mothers. Accordingly, we propose that natural selection should have favored the delayed utilization of defective oocytes in a primitive high-mortality culture, but that this evolutionary strategy would be outmoded for modern society, because it would lead to an increased frequency of birth defects for older mothers.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033929877

Alternative hypotheses suggest that defence activity may, for example, depend upon the conspicuousness of the young. Studies concerning this topic have been carried out almost exclusively on birds and experimental data on the diversity of organisms is lacking. Bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus were used to study the effects of the number and age of offspring upon the pup defence activity of mothers. Male bank voles are infanticidal and thus an adult male was used as a predator. Defence trials were conducted in the laboratory and filmed for subsequent analysis. Litter sizes were divided into three treatment groups: reduced (-2 pups), control (± 0 pups) and enlarged (+ 2 pups). In order to study the effect of offspring age upon maternal defence activity the trials were conducted twice: when the pups were 3 and 8 days old. Defence activity increased with the number of offspring and enlarged litters were most actively defended. This result supports parental investment theory and conclusions drawn by earlier studies of birds. However, in contrast to the conclusions of earlier studies, older offspring were defended less than the younger ones. Whilst new-born pups are totally defenceless against predators their vulnerability decreases as they age. Therefore, we suggest that maternal aggression in female bank voles is related to the value as well as to the vulnerability of the offspring. The validity of this explanation and the determinants of parental investment decisions in small mammals in general deserve further study.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034450215

New therapeutic strategies against advanced prostate cancer are desperately needed. As alterations in tumor-suppressor gene p16 are common in prostate cancer, one novel approach is gene therapy using a replication-deficient, E1/E3-deleted adenovirus type 5 containing a p16 under the control of a truncated Rous sarcoma virus promoter (AdRSVp16). In vitro, PC-3 cells that had been stably transfected with p16 expression vector under the control of an inducible promoter had a 70% reduction in cell number compared with the parental and control vector- transfected PC-3 cells. Similarly, AdRSVp16 significantly inhibited the growth of PPC-1 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells in culture. Furthermore, PPC-1 tumors grown in nude mice treated by a single injection of AdRSVp16 had a marked reduction in tumor size compared with untreated control-treated or vital control-treated PPC-1 tumors. Animals bearing tumors treated with AdRSVp16 also had longer survival. Adenovirally mediated expression of transgene was detected in xenograft tumors for at least 2 weeks.

However, laboratory rodents on calorie-restricted diets have extended life spans and retarded aging. One hypothesis is that this is an adaptive response involving a shift of resources during short periods of famine away from reproduction and toward increased somatic maintenance. The potential benefit is that the animal gains an increased chance of survival with a reduced intrinsic rate of senescence, thereby permitting reproductive value to be preserved for when the famine is over. We describe a mathematical life-history model of dynamic resource allocation that tests this idea. Senescence is modeled as a change in state that depends on the resources allocated to maintenance. Individuals are assumed to allocate the available resources to maximize the total number of descendants. The model shows that the evolutionary hypothesis is plausible and identifies two factors, both likely to exist, that favor this conclusion. These factors are that survival of juveniles is reduced during periods of famine and that the organism needs to pay an energetic 'overhead' before any litter of offspring can be produced. If neither of these conditions holds, there is no evolutionary advantage to be gained from switching extra resources to maintenance. The model provides a basis to evaluate whether the life-extending effects of calorie-restriction might apply in other species, including humans.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033910956

The fate of most follicles is atretic degeneration, a process that culminates in near exhaustion of the oocyte reserve at approximately the fifth decade of life in women, leading to menopause. Apoptosis has a fundamental role in follicular atresia, and recent studies have shown that Bax, which is expressed in both granulosa cells and oocytes, may be central to ovarian cell death. Here we show that young adult female Bax(-/-) mice possess threefold more primordial follicles in their ovarian reserve than their wild-type sisters, and this surfeit of follicles is maintained in advanced chronological age, such that 20-22-month-old female Bax(-/-) mice possess hundreds of follicles at all developmental stages and exhibit ovarian steroid-driven uterine hypertrophy. These observations contrast with the ovarian and uterine atrophy seen in aged wild-type female mice. Aged female Bax(-/-) mice fail to become pregnant when housed with young adult males; however, metaphase II oocytes can be retrieved from, and corpora lutea form in, ovaries of aged Bax(-/-) females following superovulation with exogenous gonadotropins, and some oocytes are competent for in vitro fertilization and early embryogenesis.

Due to its success, fry stocking should be reconsidered as a useful management tool for enhancing and restoring muskellunge populations. © 1999 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032991363

To understand the evolution of reproductive schedules, it is important to use a measure of fitness that is sensitive both to reproductive quantity and reproductive timing. There is a contradiction between the theory, which mainly focuses on the rate measures of fitness (r and λ), and empirical studies, which mainly use lifetime reproductive success (LRS), or some of its correlates, as a fitness measure. We measured phenotypic selection on age-specific fertilities in three pre-modern human populations using individually estimated finite rate of increase, e(r) (λ). We found that λ and lifetime reproductive success ranked individuals differently according to their fitness: for example, a female giving birth to four children at a young age may actually have a higher fitness than a female giving birth to six children at a greater age. Increase in fertility at the young age classes (15-19 years) was favoured by selection, but the intensity of selection on fertility was higher in the older age classes (20-30 years), where the variance in fertility was highest. Hence, variation in fertility in the older age classes (20-30) was actually responsible for most of the observed variation in fitness among the individuals. Additionally, more than 90% of variation in fitness (λ) was attributable to individual differences in LRS, whereas only about 5% of all variation in fitness was due to differences in the reproductive schedule. The rate-sensitive fitness measure did not significantly challenge the importance of total fertility as a component of fitness in humans. However, the rate-sensitive measure clearly allowed more accurate estimation of individual fitness, which may be important for answering some more specific questions.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344572798

Telomerase activity was found in all tested cells and tissue, but the activity in NHOKs and epithelial tissue was lower than that in other tested cell lines. Inasmuch as continued subculture of NHOKs results in replicative senescence, we investigated the association between telomerase activity and replicative senescence by evaluating the enzyme activity in NHOK cultures with different population doubling levels. Three different NHOK cultures were independently subcultured until these cells reached the postmitotic stage. Unlike in fibroblasts derived from the human oral cavity, significant telomerase activity was detected in rapidly proliferating NHOKs, and telomerase activity was barely detectable in the keratinocytes near and at senescence. However, the terminal restriction fragment consisting of telomeric DNA was found to be constantly maintained at ~6.0 kilobases in NHOKs without any detectable shortening of telomeres by subcultures. Intracellular p53 and p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein levels in NHOKs were gradually and significantly diminished by the passage of cells. These data indicate that actively proliferating NHOKs contain telomerase activity and that replicative senescence of NHOKs is associated with the loss of telomerase activity without shortening of telomeres. However, replicative senescence of NHOKs is apparently not linked to an accumulation of wild-type p53 and/or p21(WAF1/CIP1) proteins in these cells.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031964914

In the early or prelaying stage, success in getting a mate and initiating laying was correlated with rank in males but not in females, and with age in both females and males. In the late stage, given that a bird had a nest with eggs, fledging success was not significantly related to rank overall. In females, however, a significant interaction was found between rank and age such that top rank was associated with greater success in older but not younger females.

We here examine an auxiliary hypothesis which predicts that the degree of sexual dimorphism may also vary over the short-term, because when food is temporarily abundant, sexual selection should favour a greater growth rate of males than of females. This hypothesis concerns a phenotypic response which could introduce temporarily increased variation into an existing genotypic trait. We document the present size and sexual dimorphism of stoats introduced last century to New Zealand from Britain in relation to between-year variation in food supply in a single habitat (forests of southern beech, Nothofagus sp.). Southern beech trees produce heavy crops of flowers and seed at 3-5 year intervals, which are associated with very variable supplies of important prey of stoats, including several species of seed-eating birds, litter-feeding insects, and feral house mice (Mus musculus). Alternative prey are scarce. Regressions of condylobasal length and head-body length on mouse population indices were significant in both sexes. Mean condylobasal length was larger in both male and female stoats born after a heavy seedfall compared with those born in non-seedfall years. However, the largest males born in years of heavy seedfall were removed by selective mortality before the age of 3 years, so the condylobasal lengths for old (≤ 3.0 yr) males converged on a common mean regardless of food supply in their birth year. Sexual dimorphism did not vary with food supplies (as reflected in seedfall records or mouse population indices) at any age. First-year survivorship, at least from the age of independence, was significantly negatively correlated with density of stoats in the summer of their birth year.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030715029

A prediction of these hypotheses is that the rate of ageing should increase and the average lifespan decrease as the rate of extrinsic mortality increases. Alternatively, non-adaptive, purely mechanistic hypotheses invoke damage to DNA, cells, tissues and organs as being the unique cause of senescence and ineluctable death of organisms. Here we show that the evolution of eusociality is associated with a 100-fold increase in insect lifespan, such an increase is predicted by evolutionary theories because termite, bee and ant queens live in colonies that are sheltered and heavily defended against predators. Moreover, a comparison of ants with contrasting life histories also reveals an association between lifespan and extrinsic rate of mortality.

Variation in offspring sex ratio at the end of parental care may reflect passive sexual differences in offspring survival, or a facultative manipulation by parents to balance trade-offs between sex-specific offspring growth and survival and parental fitness. In contrast, among species with limited size dimorphism, there may be little reason to expect significant sexual differences in offspring survival, and the presence of offspring sex-ratio variation in such species may indicate sex-specific differences in parental investment at some stage. However, sex-ratio variation in monomorphic species with praecocial young may be more difficult to explain, since the decreased parental investment, which is largely shared between offspring of either sex, may reduce the opportunity for sex-ratio manipulation. 2. We examined this question by analysing annual variation in fledging sex ratio of an avian herbivore with strong female natal philopatry and praecocial young, the lesser snow goose Anser caerulescens caerulescens, using data from a 23-year observational study during a period of marked population growth. Although snow geese show limited sexual size dimorphism, with males being 2-6% larger at all ages posthatching, growth and survival of snow goose goslings has been shown previously to be extremely sensitive to variation in food supply. 3. The proportion of males at fledging has decreased from ≃51% in the early years, when food at the colony was abundant, to c. 48% in recent years, when food supply has been reduced. Concurrent with this change, the mass and condition of goslings have declined significantly over the years, with males showing a proportionately greater decline than females. Hatching sex-ratio data showed no systematic significant differences overall, and thus the most likely explanation for the change in sex ratio is increased mortality of male goslings between hatching and fledging. 4. The change in fledging sex ratio occurred only among broods from younger adults (age < 5 years). These age-specific differences were evident both among and within individual females. Younger adults may be less able to accommodate long-term changes in foraging conditions successfully, resulting in proportionately greater gosling mortality overall, and increasingly biased mortality of male goslings, which may be more susceptible to food restriction. 5. Despite potential differences in indirect costs of rearing male or female offspring, it is suggested that these results are more consistent with increased mortality of male goslings under increasing food restriction, rather than active parental manipulation.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030618146

The Ram Mountain population, monitored for 13 yr, experienced a pneumonia epizootic. Yearling survival varied among years and was lower than that of older sheep of the same sex, except for yearling males at Ram Mountain.

Rising age-specific cancer mortality rates among elderly men were increasingly correlated with growing age group population size with increasing age. This relationship was not observed in women. Since an age-specific rate should be independent of age group population size, this finding suggests that successive cohorts of elderly USA men were not comparable with respect to their susceptibility to cancer mortality. Differential survival, which effects men more than women, and its selective culling effect upon the surviving gene pool in an aging population may account for some of the observed increasing cancer mortality rates among elderly men.

The ΔarcA mutant is severely impaired in surviving prolonged periods of exogenous carbon starvation, a phenotype that can be alleviated by overproducing the superoxide dismutase SodA. In addition, flow cytometry demonstrates that starving ΔarcA mutant cells, in contrast to wild-type cells, fail to perform reductive division, remain large and contain multiple chromosomal copies. We suggest that the ArcA-dependent reduced production of electron donors and the decreased level and activity of the aerobic respiratory apparatus during growth arrest is an integral part of a defense system aimed at avoiding the damaging effects of oxygen radicals and controlling the rate of utilization of endogenous reserves.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030035132

Annual population estimates in the United States from 1951 to 1990 for age groups over 60 years old were analyzed. The rate of increase in the size of these age groups increased with increasing age. Since birth rates in developed countries have declined, this finding is a direct manifestation of differential survival over time. Correspondingly, increasing mortality rates from many disorders associated with senescence have been shown to be correlated with increasing age group population size.

We examined the reproductive success of Thick-billed Murres breeding at Coats Island, Northwest Territories, Canada to assess the extent to which a seasonal decline in success could be accounted for by correlations between the age of the birds and their date of laying. In 1990 and 1991 reproductive success declined with date of laying: this decline was due mainly to a decline in the proportion of eggs that hatched. No corresponding decline was found in the proportion of hatchlings that reached fledging age. Pairs containing at least one young (4- or 5-yr-old) bird laid later and hatched a lower proportion of eggs than those containing at least one older (>7-yr-old) bird. The two groups did not differ in the proportion of hatchlings reared. When looked at separately, the proportions of young and older birds that succeeded in hatching their egg were not affected by date of laying. When the two age groups were combined, the trends with date were similar to those found for a large sample, mostly birds of unknown age. To correct for differences in timing of laying, a sample of early breeders was induced to lay replacement eggs 14 d later. These experimental pairs were as successful as early control breeders. A greater proportion of the experimentally delayed pairs hatched chicks than birds laying for the first time at a similar date. The experimental pairs were also more successful than young birds that bred earlier. The growth of experimental and control chicks did not differ. However, the 14-d-old chicks of young pairs were lighter than those of experienced breeders, suggesting poorer provisioning by the young breeders. We concluded that there was no evidence for a deterioration in feeding conditions with date and that the relationship between age and/or experience and date of laying was the most important factor in causing the decline in reproductive success with date.

In natural cavities, old nest material accumulates with successive use. Here, we report on a two-year experiment concerned with the effects of the accumulation of used nest material in nestboxes on the reproductive success of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Tree Swallows nested in clean boxes, boxes with old, unmanipulated material, and in boxes with old nests that had been microwaved to kill parasites inside. Bird fleas (Ceratophyllus idius) were more numerous in boxes with old nest material compared to clean boxes in both years. Reproductive output and nestling size were significantly reduced in the second year of the study, possibly because of higher numbers of bird fleas in two box-types that year. However, all instances of entire brood loss that year occurred during two periods of extreme weather, so we cannot distinguish between the possible effects of parasites and climate. In one year, the swallows nested later in boxes with old material. Otherwise, nesting phenology, reproductive output, and nestling size were not different between pairs using boxes with and without old material in either year. In both years, there was a significant, positive correlation between clutch size and cavity size. Contrary to some recent studies, there were no significant associations between the numbers of fowl mites (Ornithonyssus sylviarum), bird fleas, or blowflies (Protocalliphora sialia) per nestling, and any measures of reproductive output or nestling size in either year.

The only advantage so far detected accrues to the younger partner, which gives birth, on average, several days earlier than it would as a solitary breeder and thus allows its progeny to attain a heavier weight by the time of hibernation. On the other hand, pup predation in the nest, presumably caused by the older female towards the younger's litter, was occasionally recorded.

We used plants from two populations which differed in their responses to chilling and photoperiod treatments. The timing of developmental processes was changed by controlling temperature and photoperiod regimes in growth chambers. Plasticity in size at maturity was analyzed as changes in a growth trajectory using two parameters, age at maturity (Δt) and growth rate (k). Both traits showed plasticity, but differences between the populations were found mostly for Δt. Distinctive differences in size at maturity of individuals in the two populations were mainly due to different amounts of plasticity in Δt. Variations in plasticity of nine other life history traits and their associations to age and size at maturity were also analyzed. Variation for eight of the traits can be described, at least in part, as a function of age and size at maturity for both populations, and most of the variation in the total number of seeds was explained by age and size at maturity. Only age at maturity had any effect on changes in resource allocation. The nine life history traits were integrated through associated character expressions with age and size at maturity. Changes in the association between a trait and age and/or size at maturity were rather conservative compared to changes in the plasticity of a trait between the two populations. Associations with age and size at maturity are mostly explicable in terms of inherent relationships in the developmental processes, and they may limit the ecological range expansion and the adaptive evolution of plasticity in C. flexuosa.

Separating ecological (extrinsic) factors affecting reproduction from physiological and experiential (intrinsic) factors can be problematic in free-ranging animals. This study examined age-related changes in six measures of reproductive success (clutch size, fertility, hatchability, brood size at hatching, survivorship of nestlings, and brood size at fledging) for captive female peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) where ecological factors (i.e., access to mates, nesting sites, and food) were not limiting and were similar across years and between individuals. Mean nestling survivorship increased throughout the lifespan of the female while all other measures of reproduction peaked at about seven years of age and decreased thereafter. Birds with prior breeding experience had higher productivity than inexperienced birds of the same age. Productivity increased with increasing experience of the pair. Productivity dropped by an average of 53% when females experienced a change of mate, and then subsequently increased over a period of several years. Productivity was not affected when birds were moved to different breeding sites. There was no evidence that early improvements in reproduction were related to chronological aging in the absence of experiential differences. Birds that began breeding earlier produced more fledglings during their lifetimes as a result of higher annual productivity. Lifetime reproduction was not correlated with longevity because birds with higher maximal egg production had shorter breeding lifespans. Birds retaining mates produced more fledglings during their lifetime than birds that changed mates, but birds that changed mates more than once did not have lower lifetime reproduction than birds that had only one mate change. These results suggest that 1) age-related changes in reproduction are not necessarily resource-mediated, 2) in the absence of resource limitation, experience of the pair is a primary factor determining annual reproductive success, 3) benefits of increasing experience may be offset by the onset of senescence, 4) the cost of present egg production on future reproductive potential supports a ""pleiotropic"" theory of aging, and 5) costs associated with mate changes may encourage selection for low ""divorce"" rates (i.e., lifetime monogamy) in this species. © 1995 The American Society of Zoologists.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957214371

The majority of bird species exhibit age-dependent survival and reproduction. In almost all cases, first time breeders or young individuals perform at a lower and slower rate than older individuals. This review highlights the importance of age-dependent effects and urges further study of the proximate and ultimate mechanisms involved. Age effects show substantive variation across life history stage, breeding season, year, cohort, habitat types and environmental conditions both within and across taxons. In some populations or years, age effects disappear. Despite the variable patterns, age effects show amazing persistence in a variety of extreme ecological and environmental conditions. Experimental manipulations of food, predation pressure and breeding experience do not usually remove age effects. Age-dependent effects may be maintained or accumulate through the breeding season and profoundly influence fitness, or they may be washed out or reversed by events later in the breeding season. Recently, we have amassed substantive information about the patterns of variation in age-dependent reproduction and survival among individuals, but we have made little progress toward understanding the proximate mechanisms responsible for this variation. Proximate and ultimate processes are inextricably linked, and thus the study of age-dependence is highly relevant to the further development of life history theory. Studies of age-dependent performance have general relevance to population management and conservation issues as age sub-structuring may contribute substantially to annual or inter-populational variation in reproductive success. © 1995 The American Society of Zoologists.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957213878

Most organisms reproduce episodically rather than continuously. Forms of discontinuity may include seasonal breeding in annual cycles, and delayed breeding and/or senescence over the lifespan of individuals. In addition, age can have profound effects on the annual reproductive success (RS) of a wide variety of animals. Explanations of the effects of age on RS can be confounded, however, by the acquired breeding experience of individuals, and the duration of pair-bonds, both of which have effects on RS similar to those of age itself.

Seeds from 25 families were submitted to four competitive regimes: no competition (one plant per pot), medium competition (two plants/ pot taking plants from the same population), high within-population competition (four individuals from the same population in a pot) and high between-population competition (four individuals from two different populations in a pot). Eight traits were analysed after 3 months of growth for variation among families within populations. A significant difference among families within the two older populations was recorded for sexual biomass and related components. High sensitivity of these traits to density was observed in all populations except the youngest, suggesting specialization to particular environmental conditions in late successional populations, and a good adaptive capacity to buffer environmental variation in the pioneer population. Little significant interaction between competitive regimes and families within populations was found, i.e. genotypes within each population showed little variation in their response to environmental variation. Genotypic variance decreased with increasing competitive conditions for the majority of the traits. However, the percentage of variance in sexual reproduction explained by family was stable among treatments. Tradeoffs between vegetative reproduction and sexual reproduction were recorded at the population level along the successional gradient, with increasing competitive conditions. As succession proceeds, we observed a decrease in sexual reproduction and an increase in vegetative reproduction. At the family level, correlation among traits were similar when plants were grown in the absence of competition and at high density, with a significant negative correlation between sexual reproduction and vegetative reproduction. For both sprout number and sexual biomass, the performance of families grown under all the treatments was positively correlated. Together these results indicate allocational constraints on the reproductive biology of R. acetosella that may be favoured by natural selection and have influenced population differentiation along the successional gradient. However, they also revealed that the potential exists for evolutionary specialization through plasticity, in response to variation in environmental conditions. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028975277

The lifespan of D. melanogaster males was significantly reduced by the somatic movement of a single P element in the presence of P[ry+ Δ2-3](99B) transposase. In addition, the P[ry+ SalI](89D) repressor of P[ry+ Δ2-3](99B) somatic transposasc was observed to reduce the effect of P element movement on lifespan. Finally, the frequency of somatic-cell chromosome breakage was significantly increased in neuroblasts of males with somatically active P elements.

This hypothesis is usually tested by comparing reproductive performance of individuals of the same age but having different amounts of previous breeding experience, thus using natural variation in the age of first breeding. However, individual quality may confound such a comparison, since age of first breeding is likely to covary with individual quality. I delayed experimentally the age of first breeding in female collared flycatchers Ficedula albicollis, and found that: (i) individual quality differences were likely to cause the observed higher reproductive success of unmanipulated experienced as compared with inexperienced two-year-old females; and (ii) breeding experience had no or very little effect on reproductive performance as compared with the effects of reproductive costs. A review of previous tests of the breeding experience hypothesis in birds reveals no consistent trends, although some studies suggest that breeding experience may improve reproductive performance. However, several of these studies also suggest that high-quality individuals start to breed at a younger age. Hence, at present there is no unequivocal evidence that breeding experience explains the enhanced reproductive performance with age. It is more likely that other age-related improvements in competence (e.g. foraging, nest site selection) and increased reproductive effort with age are responsible for this change.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028862641

These improvements can be seen graphically on maps produced by the USAID Child Survival Program which was launched in 1985 and which provided a ""package"" of health interventions that has led to a 10% mortality decline. These interventions have led to an increase in life expectancy in developing countries from 50 years in 1965 to over 60 years in 1986. Unfortunately, the children whose lives have been saved face a cruel paradox because their prospects for improving their lives are slim. They are the victims of deepening poverty, the stresses of urban life, and war and violence. In addition, the education which could allow them to escape their fate is largely denied to them. Although 90% of the children in developing countries enter school, an estimated 100 million drop out before grade 5. To make matters worse, most of the child survivors live in countries where the young age of the majority of the citizens is straining government resources. Even young people in the developed world are not immune from these problems; in the US, children are worse off than they were 25 years ago. While the struggle to increase child survival must continue, the world must also nurture the children who survive. The vicious cycle of population growth, poverty, and environmental degradation (PPE), which causes and is exacerbated by political and social instability, has been weakened by child survival programs which have reduced fertility rates. Education, especially of girls, also has a positive effect on the spiral. The effects of education, health and nutrition, and family planning programs can create a ""virtuous"" cycle which can increase gross domestic income and equity of income distribution (resulting in shared growth and ""human capital accumulation""). Such initiatives as innovative community youth programs and new financing mechanisms can have a longterm positive effect on the virtuous cycle if the political will exists to follow through on them.

The data of the present series were then compared with the earlier series, that is, the reference data derived from “Chino-Japanese cooperative study on physical fitness of children and youth” (1986). Regarding the mean skeletal age of reference data (13 to 17 yrs.), the Japanese are more advanced (0.6 years in boys; 0.5 years in girls) than the Chinese, respectively.

The composite measure of reproductive success increased among birds 2-6 yr of age. Increased reproductive success over these ages was due to significant increases in clutch size and gosling survival and significant reductions in probabilities of total nest and total brood failure. After age 6, the composite measure of reproductive success declined significantly. This resulted from a decrease in both hatchability and brood survival, the latter characterized by decreased gosling survival and increased frequency of total brood failure among older birds. The older age decline in reproductive performance with respect to brood-rearing may, in part, reflect senescence of physical abilities needed to competently provide parent care. However, in this philopatric species, the decline may also reflect the tendency of ageing females to continue using specific feeding areas regardless of changes in available forage. Under conditions of systematic deterioration of the environment, philopatric behaviours may become maladaptive. -from Authors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027384839

Juvenile plants comprised 5.9% of seedlings, while 65% of juveniles reached mature reproductive stage. The survivorship curve, life table and fecundity schedule reflected high mortality of seeds and seedlings. Juveniles and adults of age 7 yr showed high expectation of future life. Net reproductive rate was 0.36, indicating failure of the population to attain ""positive' growth and reproduction. Estimated intrinsic rate of increase was -0.071 per capita yr-1. Average generation time of the species was 14.4 yr. The percentage of dead whole individual plants or partially dead individuals in the population increased with age. A smaller fraction of live phytomass was allocated to roots than to stems, leaves or (in adults) inflorescences; the fraction was smaller in adults than in juveniles. The live/dead phytomass ratios were greater than unity in roots and stems. The leaves showed live/dead ratios of less than unity, being 0.69 in juveniles and 0.34 in adults. Vegetative activity occurred throughout the year with minimum cushion leafiness and leaf appearance rate during April and May. There was a significant negative linear correlation between cushion leafiness and age of plants.

This paper develops techniques for determining the proportions of that cost that accrue at each age. A variety of analyses using several different sources of data on human ageing-palaeodemographic life tables and life tables from more recent societies with high mortality rates-all suggest that the 'fitness cost' of ageing was high during most of our evolutionary history, and was largely due to physiological changes occurring early in adult life. These results imply that predictions about the nature of senescence based on evolutionary theory should be tested using data from middle-aged individuals. They also have implications about the relative importances for human evolution of the 'pleiotropy' and 'mutation-accumulation' theories of the evolution of senescence, and for the validity of 'Gompertz' Law' for the shape of the relationship between mortality and age.

Of 2940 displacement episodes, 27% occurred over natural food, 26% over provisioned food, 8% over grooming, 23% over position and shade, and 16% for other reasons. It was possible to reconstruct a displacement hierarchy that was linear and stable over short periods but fluctuated according to the age composition of the troop, resulting in an age inversed dominance structure. Females occupied top ranks as soon as they experienced menarche (around 2.4 years of age) and gradually declined thereafter, with postmenopausal females (≥30 years) being the lowest ranking individuals. Old females tended to be peripheral, while young females were highly social and active. Fertility peaked at about 7 years and gradually decreased thereafter, but infant mortality was much higher in young females than in old ones. During years when females gave birth, their ranks, especially those of old females, were higher than the average expectation for their age class, which suggests that females compete more vigorously if they have an infant. Reproductive success (i.e., infant survival to ≥2 years) declined significantly from high-over middle-to low-ranking females but did not differ for the three age classes investigated, because the higher fecundity of young females was balanced by better rearing success of older females.

Natural selection should therefore act in the direction of postponing or eliminating senescence from the life history. The widespread occurrence of senescence is explained by observing that 1) the force of natural selection is generally weaker at late ages than at early ages, and 2) the acquisition of greater longevity usually involves some cost. Two convergent theories are the ""antagonistic pleiotropy' theory, based in population genetics, and the ""disposable soma' theory, based in physiological ecology. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory proposes that certain alleles that are favoured because of beneficial early effects also have deleterious later effects. The disposable soma theory suggests that because of the competing demands of reproduction less effort is invested in the maintenance of somatic tissues than is necessary for indefinite survival. -Authors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026314114

Interviews were conducted in 1982 with 200 women who had held jobs with direct exposure and 205 women who had never held a direct-exposure job in order to ascertain information on reproductive history and other factors influencing reproductive outcome. Exposure was assessed as high-homolog PCB (Aroclor 1254), a continuous exposure variable estimated from an independently derived prediction model. After adjustment for variables other than gestational age known to influence birth weight, a significant effect of high-homolog exposure is seen for birth weight (slope of the regression β=-33 g/unit change in natural logarithm (In) estimated serum PCB; 90% confidence interval (Cl) -59 to -7; P(1)=0.02). For gestational age, a small but significant decrease is also observed with an increase in estimated exposure (β=-1.1 days/unit change in in estimated serum PCB; 90% Cl -2.0 to -0.1; P(l)=0.03). When gestational age is accounted for in addition to other variables related to birth weight, estimated serum PCB is no longer a significant predictor of birth weight (β=-24 g/unit change in estimated serum PCB; 90% Cl-49 to 2; P(1)=0.06). The authors conclude that these data indicate that there is a significant relation between increased estimated serum PCB level and decreased birth weight and gestational age, and that the decrease in birth weight is at least partially related to shortened gestational age. The magnitude of these effects was quite small compared with those of other known determinants of gestational age and birth weight, and the biologic importance of these effects is likely to be negligible except among already low birth weight or short gestation infants. © 1989 by The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024579810

Age, sex, and immigration status of the birds have a strong influence on survival rate. Male survival rate is negatively related to density of blue tits, while that of females is not. This may be related to the cost of defending a territory. Female survival rate is negatively related to the beech crop production of the previous year, which is probably an indirect measure of the number of resident males, so that the relationship reflects competition between males and females. Survival rates of immigrant males and resident females are affected by different variables from those affecting resident males and immigrant females. These differences may be related to sex differences in dispersal behaviour. In any year, females may survive better or worse than males and independently immigrants may survive better or worse than residents. These differences in survival between groups are not consistent in direction, although sometimes strongly significant. -from Authors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024191159

In order to recognize these influences we need to know normal or average values for these quantities, as well as normal disturbances likely to create sampling errors. Variance normal to Sand martins includes (1) that there is pronounced age segregation within colonies, (2) that survival rates of juveniles decrease with progressing fledging date, and (3) that adult survival rates vary by at least a factor of three in the course of 10–15 years. In addition to heavy overall mortality, catastrophic winter conditions create biased sex ratios among older birds: females of age ≥ 3y gradually disappear. Stress on older birds due to their higher breeding contributions (double broods) is the probable cause. This differential mortality—a characteristic of the population as a whole, not of one colony‐is compensated for by distinct, precisely timed (counter‐)biased sex ratios among first‐time breeders. So far there has been no reason to assume that these ratios are created by exclusion of members of either sex from breeding. The age structure of a population becomes compressed during periods (prolonged over some years) of adverse weather, and expands during favourable periods. This brings a shift from general vulnerability to general stamina in its train. All changes are remarkably continuous, in a sense never really ‘catastrophic’, because of the moderating influences of age structure and sex ratios. In south Sweden Sand martins are heavily preyed upon by badgers. Most of the predation occurs during periods of dry weather, when earthworms are difficult to procure. However, the observed oscillations (Persson, 1987a) cannot be the outcome of a predator‐prey relation: several prerequisites are not fulfilled. It is assumed, instead, that the population involved is self‐ regulating, although this self‐regulation may very well be accentuated by predation. 1987 The Zoological Society of London",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985398437

The animals studied were those that died of natural causes within a laboratory population that was established to provide Aplysia for sacrifice in an experimental program. Actuarial separation of the former group from the latter was justified by theoretical consideration. Age-specific mortality rates were calculated from the survival data. Statistical fluctuation arising from the small size of the population was reduced by grouping the data in bins of unequal age duration. The durations were specified such that each bin contained approximately the same number of data points. An algorithm for choosing the number of data bins was based on the requirement that the precision with which the age of a group is determined should equal the precision with which the number of deaths in the groups is known. The Gompertz and power laws of mortality were fitted to the age-specific mortality-rate data with equally good results. The positive values of slope associated with the mortality-rate functions as well as the linear shape of the curve of survival provide actuarial evidence that Aplysia age.

The product of α and T lies between 2 and 12 for mammals which have ceased to grow in their adult years, fish which continue to grow throughout life and rotifers, which have a constant number of cells. Since T is related to the metabolic rate, m, as m- 3 4, then α must be related to the metabolic rate as m+ 3 4. It is suggested that somatic mutations play a lesser role than metabolism in aging. © 1981.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019429769

Old leaves and leaves of mature forest plants are expected to be better defended than ephemeral young leaves and leaves of early successional plants. These predicted patterns of plant defence and the resultant patterns of insect grazing are not well documented for natural communities. Field studies have shown that mammalian herbivores in a tropical forest prefer young leaves7 and that insect grazing in a temperate forest is heaviest on the young leaves8. Laboratory studies have shown that late successional species9,12 or plants with certain chemical defences13-17 are less palatable for generalist herbivores. Laboratory results depend, however, on the particular herbivore tested, and may not accurately predict rates of herbivory in natural systems. Here I report on rates of herbivory on young and mature leaves from tree species with different life history patterns. Grazing rates (% leaf area eaten per day) on mature leaves of fast growing, shade-intolerant species (pioneers) were an order of magnitude greater than those on slow growing, shade-tolerant species (persistents). Young leaves in both groups of species suffered significantly greater grazing damage than mature leaves. © 1980 Nature Publishing Group.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000497481

The experiment was conducted in a low intertidal boulder field in southern California. In this habitat, the top surfaces of boulders are covered with algae. The composition of the assemblage on any particular boulder depends on the length of time since it was last overturned by wave action. When a boulder is overturned, the algae on what was formerly the top surface, are killed in whole or part by a combination of sea urchin grazing, anoxia, light levels below compensation intensity, and mechanical damage caused by crushing or abrasion. The length of time that a boulder remains overturned and the local abundance of sea urchins determines the intensity of the disturbance. When the boulder is righted, recolonization begins either by vegetative regrowth of survivors and/or by spores from outside. Using a three-factorial design, this natural form of disturbance was experimentally mimicked and the responses of three different successional stages of the algal community monitored. Boulders in each successional category were overturned for periods of 17, 27 and 54 days in areas with and without sea urchins, then righted. Two aspects of community response to perturbation were evaluated. These were (1) the assemblage's ability to resist change and (2) its ability, if altered, to adjust to some semblance of its original state. The resistance of each assemblage and of its component species to change was measured by the percent decrease in algal cover and by the decline in percent similarity of the community to its original composition. The recovery rate of each assemblage and of the cover lost by each species during the first 35 days following a disturbance was measured by the rate of increase in percent similarity to the original composition and the percent reestablishment of lost cover. The experimental evidence demonstrates that the successional stages of the producer level of an intertidal algal community differ significantly in their responses to disturbance. Early successional communities suffer more damage from a given level of perturbation but recover more quickly than either middle or late successional communities. Damage to any particular assemblage of algae, irrespective of successional age, is more extensive and recovery slower, the longer the boulder is overturned and/or sea urchins are present. Several thresholds in these responses were also identified. Differences in community responses and non-linearities in these responses were attributable to the life history characteristics of the component species rather than emergent properties of the assemblage. These characteristics have evolved in response to a variety of recurrent natural disturbances. This interpretation is in agreement with recent critical reevaluations of the trends and mechanisms of successional change in natural communities. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002869960

The annual reporting probability is assumed to be the same for all birds and to remain constant from year to year, while the probability of survival is assumed to depend on the age of the bird rather than on the calendar year. By considering the probability distribution of band returns conditional on the total numbers of returns from each release, explicit maximum likelihood estimates of the survival probabilities are obtained together with their asymptotic variance-covariance matrix. A goodness-of-fit test of the model is outlined and the theory is demonstrated by a worked example. © 1971 Oxford University Press.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001277609
